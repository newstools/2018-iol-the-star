Workers from Jet Demolition were seen outside the Bank of Lisbon building on Wednesday morning, and their vehicles remained parked there for most of the day. Gauteng government spokesperson Thabo Masebe said the building was badly damaged but would not confirm whether it will be demolished. “The building sustained quite serious structural damage. We are still busy looking at a number of options. Once we arrive at a point of deciding what happens, we will notify the public,” Masebe said. He said Jet Demolition staff may have been there to do an assessment. There was a lot of activity outside the building, with workers installing fencing around it. Jet Demolition's Tia Haydock said: “Unfortunately we are not at liberty to discuss any details of the project at this stage. You are welcome to contact us in mid-January.” Workers on site said they had been deployed to start preparations for the demolition of the building. They said planning for the demolition could take up to four months and expected that it would take place in the middle of next year. Dozens of firefighters were dispatched to the Bank of Lisbon building in the Joburg CBD on September 5 after a fire broke out. The building, which was found to be only 21% compliant with the health and safety standards, housed three government departments - Human Settlements, Health, and Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs. Before a building can be deemed safe for occupation it has to meet 85% of the occupational, safety and health standards. Despite warnings and complaints from employees and unions, no action was taken to move workers from these departments. Firefighters Simphiwe Moropane, 28, Khathutshelo Muedi, 37, and Mduduzi Ndlovu, 40, lost their lives as they battled the blaze in the building, which had no water.
