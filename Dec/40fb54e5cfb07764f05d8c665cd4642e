The fire department battled to put out the flames in the area owing to the lack of fire hydrants. Radebe said it was difficult to contain the raging flames in such conditions. “There are no hydrants here because people built on top of them. It is now making the job of the firefighters difficult,” she said.     Scores of families were left homeless, with some scrambling to save their belongings. It’s not clear what started the inferno, which began at the corner of London Road and 18th Avenue. No fatalities and injuries were reported. Radebe urged those wanting to assist to drop off food and clothes at the Sandton and Alexandra fire stations. Many of the pictures and videos circulating on social media show despondent Alex residents, watching on helplessly as their homes go up in flames.
