This was said by MMC for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba, who visited some of the parks over the weekend to help educate people. "But with over 2170 facilities, Joburg City Parks and Zoo (JCPZ) is unable to cope with people who disregard the city's open-space by-laws. “The aim of the ongoing partnership with the Joburg metro police on the eve of the holidays is to educate residents visiting the parks and to clamp down on transgressors,” Sifumba said. The JCPZ will be operational over the festive season with an essential staff complement. Contractors will be undertaking proactive horticultural maintenance. Rangers and metro police will randomly patrol flagship parks. Residents may also call 011 712 6600 to register their requests for services.  * Residents can follow the link to the city's park and open-space by-laws: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tOCEEM5bn1IX2i55aBTyKJJ64o25X-sA/view?usp=sharing Some of examples of by-laws include: No person may, within a public open space: Act in a manner which is dangerous to life or property Contravene the provisions of any notice within any public open space Cause a nuisance, or Behave in an indecent or offensive manner.
