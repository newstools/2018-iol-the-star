But now Ledwaba's family are struggling to get compensation more than a year after the Life Esidimeni arbitration was concluded. Ledwaba's nephew, also named David, was on Monday part of the group of families who protested outside Gauteng Premier David Makhura's office, demanding payment. The 83-year-old man had died in June 2016, allegedly after an epileptic fit, and buried. Ledwaba attended almost all of the arbitration sittings but his heart broke when at the end he was informed he would not get a payout because his uncle was moved before the Gauteng mental health marathon project. The arbitration awarded R1.2million to the survivors and the families of those who had died. Gauteng government spokesperson Thabo Masebe said the families who were part of the arbitration had already received their payouts.
