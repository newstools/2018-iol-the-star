Lumka Xoxo, lawyer for 58-year-old Johannes Molefe, asked the South Gauteng High Court on Tuesday to postpone the proceedings because she was not yet ready to deliver her defence arguments. Journalists arrived in court to find Xoxo paging through her notes. She then asked the clerk of the court to inform Judge Peet Johnson that she would like a postponement. Johnson then called Xoxo and State prosecutor Jacki Steyn to his chambers to discuss the requested postponement. Then Steyn confirmed to Johnson that the State was not opposed to the postponement. “This matter is postponed for Xoxo to prepare her address. You are remanded in custody,” Judge Johnson told Molefe, who was led to the cells. Molefe was arrested last year after news broke out that scores of girls at a Soweto primary school had been raped and sexually assaulted. He is facing three charges of rape and 11 of sexual assault. The state has laid its case against Molefe, calling his alleged primary school victims to the stand. A 10-year-old girl told the court that Molefe, whom pupils called Mkhulu, made her model for him before groping her and another child. Another girl, a 7-year-old, testified that Molefe inserted his finger into her vagina. He had called the child to his guardroom, which is near the school gate. She told the court that she cried during the assault, only for Molefe to tell her not to cry. A mother of a 9-year-old testified that her daughter told her that Molefe touched her breasts and bums and told her he wanted to make her his second wife. @BonganiNkosi87
