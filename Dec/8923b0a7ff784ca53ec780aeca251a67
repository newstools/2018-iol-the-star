For Ronald Manyiki, the reopening of schools will come too late after two little boys, David (his son) and Khumo (his son's friend), smeared oil all over his car. Both boys are 4 years old. “Guys, you don’t know how angry I am,” wrote @Manyiki on Twitter, alongside images of the two children and the oil-smeared vehicle. An oil container and black plastic can be seen near the silver grey VW Polo.   Manyiki on Monday said all was forgiven. Twitter users, however, found the post funny, with some saying the boys were too cute to be mad at and that they were creative and had had an art session. @lela_m1 said: “If you guys ever need a mechanic At least they didn’t drink the oil.” Another user, @ChristoThurston, said: “They made oil painting. Polo ala oil.” @MsPuntie said @Manyiki should be grateful that the children did not have matches. “Indeed because there was no kaboom,” said @Sandile_Kewana. @WAtluvutluvu said: “There’s nothing wrong here, our kids prefer brown colour than silver. Simply change the colour, brother.” Other Twitter users shared little stories about what their little ones have been getting up to these holidays. @iamSbalCOOL said: "I can't wait for schools to reopen, I'm tired of watching cartoons the whole day every day.” Another user, @SbuMpungose, said: “Imagine if there was no school for life & every day they were plotting naughtiness... we would not survive our children!” Schools reopen on January 9 across the country.
