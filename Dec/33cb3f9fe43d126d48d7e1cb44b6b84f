Producer Lyall Ramsden said the production would have a twist. “It’s actually not The Nutcracker story, but is based on the themes and music of The Nutcracker and Tchaikovsky's music. There are one or two numbers that feature in the actual performance.” Ramsden said the project was a year in the making, with lots of hard work, logistics and getting the right team together. “We had auditions at the beginning of August and identified and brought up some professional ballerinas from Durban, with the rest from Joburg.” The costumes for the production were made from scratch. “We printed our own fabric, which was quite something. "We had bespoke fabric designed by our designer Andrew Botha and had the fabric printed. "And our costumes were fabricated into Victorian by two members who used to belong to the State Theatre opera days, so we’ve gone all out to make all this happen.” Ramsden described the circus as magical. “I think it is a magical theatrical adventure, with elements of puppetry in it. We have an orang-utan in the show, a puppet, and elements of physical theatre with the ballet, which will be a big feature. There’s a saying that those who don’t believe in magic will never find it, and this is what the circus is all about.” The Nutcracker's Winter Circus will be on show at Sandton City’s centre court. The circus will run with four shows daily from this Wednesday to January 6.
