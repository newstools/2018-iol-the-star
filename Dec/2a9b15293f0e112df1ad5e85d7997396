All the 52 people who bought their jobs at Soweto’s Bheki Mlangeni District Hospital will keep them despite having obtained them fraudulently. However, 11 sellers of the jobs resigned while the disciplinary processes were still pending while others were dismissed. This was revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa in a written reply to DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC Jack Bloom around details on the jobs-for-sale scandal at the hospital. The people who bough the jobs are 20 cleaners, 15 clerks, 10 enrolled nurse and seven porters. The prices for the jobs ranged from R2000 to R10000 and it is believed that the buyers were not dismissed as they had come forward and co-operated with authorities during investigations. “Employees found guilty after pleading guilty before independent Presiding Ofﬁcers were given sanctions, suspensions without pay including final written warning, owing to the evidence presented to an independent Presiding officers which such evidence may evince a degree of remorselessness, divulging honestly and truthfully,” Ramokgopa said. Bloom said he was uneasy at the leniency shown in this instance, saying jobs-for-cash as well as jobs-for-sex were quite prevalent in hospitals and throughout the Gauteng Provincial Government. "It is grossly unfair that unscrupulous people get jobs that would have gone to better qualified people. Fair access to jobs should be guaranteed with honest administration and punishment of those who seek to profit from the desperation of job seekers," Bloom said. In September, The Star reported that some women employees claimed that  they have been forced to sleep with a senior manager in exchange for jobs at the hospital. At least five female employees currently working at the hospital in Jabavu were said to have slept with the human resources officer (whose name is known to The Star) at the centre of the scandal to secure their jobs. Others were allegedly fired for rejecting his advances.
