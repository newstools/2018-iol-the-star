Johannesburg - Pastor Paseka Motsoeneng, well-known as Prophet Mboro, has scored R100 000 - plus 15.5% interest counted from 2014 - for unlawful arrest and being detained for 11 hours. The South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg, has ordered the Police Ministry to pay Motsoeneng the money, as he has won the lawsuit he brought in 2014. Police also have to pay Motsoeneng’s legal fees. His arrest happened in 2011 at a Bedford View shopping centre. He was arrested with three members of his church for alleged possession of illegal firearms. The four were released because it turned out the firearms were actually legal. They belonged to the pastor’s bodyguards. Mboro was released without setting foot before a magistrate. He argued, in the civil court, that he was arrested for the alleged possession of firearms though he had no firearm with him. One person also arrested was not found with a gun. Only two had the registered firearms in their possession. Motsoeneng arrived in court on Tuesday with some members of his church, Incredible Happenings. They held a brief prayer before Acting Judge D Makhuba read out his order. Addressing reporters after the ruling, an elated Motsoeneng said his arrest was humiliating. Police grabbed him by his private parts during the arrest, he said. His lawyer, Andries Grove said: “It became a huge spectacle with 40, 50 to 60 people gathering around to watch.” bongani.nkosi@inl.co.za The Star
