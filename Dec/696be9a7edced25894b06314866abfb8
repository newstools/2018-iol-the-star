The award ceremony seeks to celebrate hip hop musicians who have achieved and grown in 2017/2018. Awards organiser Osmic Menoe said he was looking forward to December 19, when the event takes place. “There will be a celebration of the culture because the awards are now seven years old. I am talking about the award ceremony that a lot of people didn't believe in, in the beginning. "And the fact that we are on SABC1 celebrating and awarding people who have achieved so much within the culture, that should be exciting,” he said. Local hottest female hip hop DJ MsCosmo is one of the most nominated performers. She is nominated in the category of DJ of the Year, Best Collabo and Best Video.

Blessed,” she said. Rapper and TV presenter Moozlie is nominated in three categories. “I'm nominated for Best Female, Best Freshman (New Comer) and Best Mixtape. I also have two other joint nominations with Ms Cosmo, Rouge and Sho Madjozi for Best Collaboration and Best Video for our song Ay Baby. “When you name your album Victory, you definitely expect to be winning some awards!
