The aspiring entrepreneur says unemployment is a crisis in the country and he wants to change that. “I want to be a millionaire by the time I am 18. I want to change the world, so many people are struggling and I want my business to make a difference,” he said. The six-year-old boy opened his own business called Quirk Quirk Inc early this year. He has a passion for arts and all form of creativity. He started the business targeting individuals but has now opened up a new market for corporates that are buying from him. He makes origami and handmade stationery. He gets his peers to assist with the demand and has trained them himself. His mother Prudence Mabitsela said she refused to be a part of the black culture that teaches and enforces children to get education and find a job rather than starting a business of their own. “The sad reality is in our culture, we are taught to go to school, varsity and then find a job. Nobody tells us that we can be entrepreneurs, hire people and be millionaires. “Mommy, I’m selling these quirk quirks to you and daddy for R100 each, Omphile said in the first stages of his business. “I could have been ignorant and refused but I decided to say, come let me see,” said Prudence. From there on, she supported the vision and steered him towards his mission. His mother said thus far he has sold over 200 origami creations and he charges R10 each. Prudence said: “I talk to him. Omphile has the mind of an old person. But more than anything he is surrounded by warmth, love and positivity which will make him grow into a positive role model to others.” Omphile, who is now going to Grade 2, was described as a strong-willed person who is able to face challenges and was taught by his mother to always be the bigger person. “I want to enable him to make his dreams come true,” she said.
