Mash Braai House, which was based at the Buzz Shopping Centre in Fourways, closed its doors this month following a supposed dispute with the landlord, which began last month, and put 57 more people on the unemployment line days before Christmas. Ngwato Mashilwane, owner of Mash Braai House, said on Thursday that he could not rule out racism because “a whole lot of excuses” and “uncalled for attitudes and accusations” were made against the eatery’s patrons, who have been accused to have been “filthy”. “We always clean thoroughly, every night and morning before we open. “How they come to the conclusion that our customers are dirty, I do not know,” Mashilwane said, adding that he only hosted high-end clients. He added that his food business would take a knock as they had a lease with Buzz Shopping Centre which was expected to end at the end of 2019. Mashilwane said an amicable agreement was reached with the landlord last month that his establishment would close doors this Sunday, but now centre has reneged on the deal and shut down the place earlier this month. “When our attorney and the landlord’s attorney met, we were told that this (lease) had to end and that (other) tenants had withheld their rent, saying that our customers are dirty. “It was just a whole lot of excuses. So, we decided that, it’s fine, let’s end it all here, let them pay us what they owe us and the rest of the legal procedures will unfold as it does,” Mashilwane said. The Star contacted Fred Rotham, the shopping centre’s manager, who refused to comment. He directed all queries to the centre’s lawyer, Riaan Swanepoel. Repeated calls to Swanepoel’s office and personal cellphone went unanswered. Mashilwane said the Fourways branch had 72 employees, some of whom would be absorbed at the Midrand establishment.
