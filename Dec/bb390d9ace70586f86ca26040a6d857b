Eighty nines babies, 47 girls and 42 boys, were born on Christmas day in Gauteng’s public health facilities just before midday. This means that there could be more babies born on that day as the number did not include those born late in the afternoon as well as in the evening. Most of the babies, 14, were born at Tembisa Hospital before midday followed by Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic hospital with 12 babies. A mother with her Christmas baby. Addressing new mothers at Sebokeng Hospital Maternity Unit on Christmas Day,  Gauteng MEC for Health Gwen Ramokgopa, encouraged the mothers to practise exclusive breastfeeding for six months, saying breast milk was very important in babies as it provides them with all the necessary nutrients that they need to grow up to be healthy and strong. She also stressed the importance of fathers' presence in their children’s lives.  “Fathers should be directly involved and take responsibility in raising their babies. This is a precious and golden moment to be shared with both parents. Mothers here, indicated that the fathers are working, I hereby call on employers to grant fathers paternity leave so that they can be part of this joyful moment and experience bonding with their babies immediately”, she said.

Ramokgopa also thanked health care workers who instead of being with their families on Christmas Day were at work to ensure that those that require medical assistance get it.  “A special thank you to all the healthcare workers who are working on this day and ensuring that quality healthcare is rendered in all public health facilities across the province. Your hard work and dedication is recognised and appreciated. Keep up the good work.”
