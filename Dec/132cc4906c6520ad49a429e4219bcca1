The singer has been through her fair share of turmoil when it comes to relationships. She was recently trolled on social media for her relationship with hip hop star Chad Da Don, with some dismissing it as a public relations stunt. However, she silenced the debate yesterday after posting an image of her and Da Don’s hands with each other’s initials on their ring fingers and captioned it: “I sad (sic) YES #MeetTheMansoors.” Da Don also shared the same picture on his Instagram page with the caption: “I asked. She said yes. Love you my queen.” Move! magazine issued a public apology to Khumalo last month after she slammed a “racist” cover line about her relationship with Da Don. A part of the cover line read: “Kelly Khumalo madly in love with umlungu (white person).” The editor later issued a statement on social media stating the umlungu reference had no relevance to the story. “The reference was light-hearted and I agree with many readers that it has no relevance to the story. I apologise to Kelly Khumalo and readers who may be offended by the headline,” the statement said.
