Radio Bop, the erstwhile commercial station that launched the careers of among others Tim Modise, Shado Twala and Bob Mabena is back on the airwaves...albeit online. It even has the same logo and tagline. The only difference is that Bop now stands for Beats Of Pleasure instead of Radio Bophuthatswana. The English medium station was formed under the Bophuthatswana bantustan regime under the leadership of the late President Manyane Mangope but was shut down in the early 2000s. However, those that are still nostalgic about the days that the station  dominated the airwaves can now go down memory lane and listen to it online. The station was recently launched in front of an audience of about 300 people at The Market Theatre. It is also a  media sponsor of the "Letta Mbulu Songbook" with Nokukhanya Dlamin - a tribute to the legendary musician and composer Letta Mbulu. Mongezi C Makhalima, managing director of the station, said they found there have been many people who missed the values the station represented as well as the legacy it left "We chose to use the same familiar logo to connect to the audiences and maintained everything that was wholesome and made Radio BOP an Icon," he said. Some of the new presenters include Collen Lemawana, Phokeng Mohotlane, Hector Motivator, who was part of the original Radio Bop before itshut down, as well as Mongezi Makhalima. The station is currently streaming on Www.radiobop.co.za and will soon be launching an app in January 2019.
