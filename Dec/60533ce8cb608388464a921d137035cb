The suspects allegedly tried to solicit the bribe from a Roodepoort resident. It is alleged they approached the residents and promised to clear their electricity debt in exchange for R3500. One resident agreed to pay the amount and then informed the city’s group forensic and investigation services (GFIS) team. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department and the investigation services team then set up a sting operation, resulting in the arrest of both suspects. The pair were expected to appear in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba commended the residents for refusing to be part of "any corrupt activity and reported the matter to our team which acted swiftly to deal with the matter. “In the context of the city’s billing challenges, acts of corruption only serve to worsen the difficult circumstances which our residents have been forced to live under for years. “Corruption has no place in the city which is working tirelessly to ensure that it is eradicated," he said. People can report fraud and corruption on the 24-hour tip-off hotline 0800002587 or visit GFIS offices at 48 Ameshoff Street, Braamfontein.
