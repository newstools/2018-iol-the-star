The North West police have opened a missing person case after a Rustenburg man went missing on December 3. Omphemetse Moagi, also known as Mops, was last seen last week Monday. Apparently, Omphemetse had returned home to start his own company after resigning from Fraser Alexander, a company that provides services in the mining sector. According to his sister, Olebogeng Moagi, Omphemetse left the house as if he would return. “Apparently he was home. He was with my dad. He told my dad that he is coming back. He only took one of the phones that he used for WhatsApp. He left his other phone. He was busy his laptop and left it. “I got a call the next morning saying your brother hasn’t come home. We looked for him and his girlfriend said she doesn’t know where he is. She said they had a general conversation on the phone,” she said. Olebogeng, who is Omphemetse's only sibling, said she hopes her brother will return home “unhampered”. In a series of tweets, Omphemetse’s close friend Samantha Letshedi asked the public to help.     The Star understands that Omphemetse drives a white BMW. Police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed that they found an abandoned car in Klerksdorp. “A missing person enquiry has been opened for investigation. No arrest has been made so far. The missing person’s car was abandoned in Klerksdorp and it appears to be on good condition,” he said @SthembisoMedia
