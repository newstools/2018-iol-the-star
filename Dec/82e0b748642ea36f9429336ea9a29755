The trio last year entered the airport wearing police uniforms, using a bakkie marked as a police vehicle and another white vehicle, with sirens and flashing blue lights, and stole the money. The three, Sibusiso Job Mnisi, Prince Raphael Dube and Frans Mathabatha Manaka, snatched 27 bags containing R24million in foreign currency from a South African Airways flight. Mnisi was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery and was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Dube was sentenced to 45 years, after being convicted on two counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, one of theft and another of false representation (presenting himself as a police officer). Manaka was convicted on two counts of robbery and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. In handing down sentences, the court took into account that there were no fatalities during the time when these offences were committed. However, Acting Judge Daniel Mogotsi said he could also not impose a lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed sentence due to the seriousness of the offences committed. In his argument in aggravation of sentence, State advocate Faghre Mohamed emphasised the need for the criminal justice system to arrest the situation against cash in transit robberies, as they have an adverse effect on the country's economy. Mohamed said the airport was the main port that visitors to the country use, it should be safe. Advocate Andrew Chauke, Director of Public Prosecutions in the Gauteng Local Division, said: “The NPA is satisfied that the court arrived at a just sentence, one that is proportionate to the seriousness of the crimes committed. The sterling work by members of the criminal justice system in foiling the robbery is applauded.”
