This followed an investigation by the international body into the death of eight antelopes which had to be euthanised at OR Tambo International Airport after allegedly being left in poor conditions there by the zoo. They had been donated by Prague Zoo, which lodged the complaint. Johannesburg Zoo was temporarily suspended as a member and its accreditation status revoked. JCPZ managing director Bryne Maduka said the membership ensures that all zoos comply with a strict code of ethics aimed at regulating and improving professional standards. It also ensures Johannesburg Zoo adheres to good animal welfare practices, has a functional ethics committee and practises ethical animal exchange programmes to benefit conservation and education. Waza is the globally accredited body with ethical oversight of conservation in more than 50 countries, and has over 400 active members. MMC for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba welcomed the reinstatement.
