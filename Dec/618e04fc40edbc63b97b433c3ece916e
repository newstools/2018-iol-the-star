The pilot involves 600 people from the Riverlea old age home, Horse Shoe in Riverlea, the Chiswick old age home in Coronationville, and Park Cottages in Bertrams. Metrobus currently offers monthly discounts to pensioners and people with disabilities. Transport MMC Nonhlanhla Makhuba said the project would be re-evaluated after six months to involve pensioners and the disabled city-wide from July next year. In partnership with the Department of Social Development, some pensioners and people with disabilities have already been registered. Old age homes in Soweto will be visited for the registration. Rea Vaya customer care centres at the Orlando police station, Carlton, the University of Johannesburg and Sophiatown will be used to register pensioners and people with disabilities from today until the initial target of 600 for the pilot project is reached. People must bring their Sassa cards and IDs or medical proof of disability for registration. All participants in the pilot will receive smart cards loaded with 20 trips a month to use the service and travel for free. They can reload their cards at their nearest Rea Vaya customer care centres every month. Makhuba urged pensioners and people with disabilities to travel at off-peak times between 8.30am and 1pm.
