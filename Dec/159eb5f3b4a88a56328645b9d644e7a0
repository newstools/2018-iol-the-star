This has caused a huge outcry by residents in the city’s 13 centres, from Edenvale to Nigel, who have accused the city of poor planning by giving staff leave over the festive season. The city on Tuesday issued a statement informing residents of the closure of all the municipal swimming pools over the period. Member of the mayoral committee for community services Dora Mlambo said the swimming pools would be closed due to the limited number of officials, including lifeguards, available during this time, as most have taken leave. “As such, this may pose a challenge in adhering to basic health and safety requirements at the facilities,” said Mlambo. She said they acknowledged the inconvenience that the closures may cause, but the health and safety of bathers were the city’s first priority. Pools were to be closed at 6pm on Friday and would reopen on January 2. A number of residents have lodged complaints with The Star. Said Palm Ridge resident Nonhlanhla Mvelwa: “We live in places with no parks or pools. "Now we are deprived of swimming facilities, which we were prepared to pay entrance fees for. "What are our children to do during the holidays? The pools keep them off the streets during the holidays,” she said. A disgruntled Katlehong resident, Pete Ngobeni, said: “What is the use of reopening in January? Our kids will be back at school by then.” The DA in Ekurhuleni has condemned the move and said it would be petitioning the council to reopen the pools. However, the next council meeting is scheduled only for the end of next month. Malcolm Maifala, the DA spokesperson on community services in Ekurhuleni, said: “Summer is here, and the residents don't have access to swimming pools during this festive season."
