The final instalment of the Birchwood Comes Alive Jazz Evening was the culmination of a year filled with great memories. This weekend’s line-up saw Mi Casa, for the second consecutive year, close off the event in true style. Acts that have made the event worth the memories included jazz great Selaelo Selota, Ringo Madlingozi and Mafikizolo who have graced the stage many times in the 17 years of its existence. The December edition is always a party that sees many social groups come together to celebrate their end of year parties. Supporting Mi Casa was the band Encore and singer Samu. Nina Hastie was there to provide the comedic entertainment. Encore’s performance deserved their namesake as the lead singer’s voice had the audience begging for more. The group has also been on the Birchwood stage before, impressing the jazz lovers with their authentic sound. Samu, in addition to her own songs, sang renditions of There is Music In The Air by Letta Mbulu and Nizalwa Ngobani by Thandiswa Mazwai. Hastie brought her brand of Pretoria funny to the event which is held every month except January at the Birchwood Hotel and OR Tambo Conference Centre. Mi Casa’s whole act was an energy filled dance session that went on until the wee hours of the morning.
