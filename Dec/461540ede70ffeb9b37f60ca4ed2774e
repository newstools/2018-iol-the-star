Johannesburg -Three vehicle examiners and a data capturer have been arrested on allegations of illegally licensing unroadworthy vehicles. It is believed that the four, who work at Daveyton Vehicle Testing Station - a private testing facility - may have certified 46 vehicles without physically examining them. Their arrest was part of the festive anti-corruption drive by the Road Traffic Management Corporation's (RTMC) National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit and the Hawks. RTMC's Simon Zwane said the anti-corruption police raided the premises of the company, which conducts roadworthiness tests in Daveyton. He said the modus operandi was for motorists whose cars needed road worthy certificates to approach the vehicle examiners. He said the motorists would then pay about R1000 then give their vehicle's particulars to the examiner who would then take them, enter that information in the computer and the illegally issue the roadworthy certificate. " We have been investigating the for months and also got information from our informers. We will be applying to the Department of Transport to revoke Daveyton Vehicle Testing Station's license and also that it is down. "Computers and documents were seized during the raid and will be analysed as part of the investigation," he said. Zwane said they also were going to trace the motorists who benefited from the corrupt scam and they may face fraud charges. "We will find then, give them the benefit of the doubt and listen to their storie," he said. Zwane said the RTMC has prioritised corruption in efforts to make roads safer this festive season. The Star
