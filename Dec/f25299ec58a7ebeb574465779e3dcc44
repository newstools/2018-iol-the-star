Alex Ruta, a former soldier who was allegedly sent to South Africa to assassinate exiled opponents of President Paul Kagame, was barred from applying for asylum because he brought it after being illegal in the country for 15 months and being jailed for road offences. Ruta, who was allegedly smuggled into South Africa without any papers by Rwanda’s National Security Services, was on a police protection programme when he was arrested for driving a motorcycle without a licence. He stopped Home Affairs from deporting him by winning a battle at the high court, but the department later had this ruling overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). On Thursday, Justice Edwin Cameron ruled on Ruta’s appeal application against the SCA’s judgment, and found in Ruta’s favour. Justice Cameron said the SCA itself had clarified in several rulings that Home Affairs had no grounds to decline processing asylum-seeker applications of foreign nationals who presented themselves to its offices after being in the country illegally.
