The clinic is set to bring relief to working people who cannot afford private health around Cosmo City, Roodepoort, but also don’t want to wait in long queues at the local clinic, or to travel to the closest public hospitals which are at least 30 minutes away. The clinic also plans to support the re-engineering of primary healthcare throughout the country to drive down the costs of private healthcare. It was launched in collaboration with health NGO, Right-to-Care and the Gauteng Department of Health. The Esizayo Clinic has modern facilities and best-practice primary healthcare services which include a doctor and nurse. Patients pay R350 which includes a consultation with a doctor or nurse, screening, testing and medication. Antiretrovirals and immunisations are extra, although the clinic is working to offer these at reduced prices. Speaking at the launch, Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said: “The clinic at the multi-purpose centre in Cosmo City sees as many as 4000 patients per month. The Cosmo City population of more than 70000 is growing fast. Hence this clinic is much-needed here and will relieve the burden at nearby facilities.” Professor Ian Sanne, chief executive of Right-to-Care, said: “We are focused on delivering the gold standard of primary health care at a reduced price and will use the Esizayo Clinic as a model for how to expand into communities which have insufficient healthcare access. “The clinic is also a learning hub. We have partnered with Wits University’s health sciences faculty.” Sanne said the 2.2-hectare site may expand to accommodate a 16-room public primary healthcare facility, a 100-bed private hospital and shared services that include a maternity section, pharmacy, and 24-hour emergency room.
