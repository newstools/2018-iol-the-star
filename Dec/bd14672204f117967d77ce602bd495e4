Two Westbury residents were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly inciting public violence during a protest over the release of suspected killers of Heather Peterson. Petersen was killed by a stray bullet in an alleged gang shooting shooting while walking with her 10 year old niece in the area in September, she died at the scene. The 10 year old girl was wounded. Four men were arrested for the shooting but two were recently released and that sparked a protest that led to a man and woman being arrested. Furious community members then gathered at the Sophiatown police station demanding the detained man and woman to be released. They said they were not happy with the fact that the two men were released, saying they live a house away from Peterson's widower. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela confirmed that a man and a woman were arrested on Wednesday morning for public violence. “They were protesting over the release of two suspects who were arrested in connection with the murder of the woman.The family of the victim was informed by the court why the suspects were released,”Makhubela said. He also stated that the case against the two men was provisionally withdrawn as they have not been positively linked to the murder. “The other two suspects are still in custody and the case is still being investigated,” he added. Peterson's death plunged the Westbury community into violent protests that resulted in residents shutting down the area. The unrest left scores of people injured and police minister Bheki Cele visited the area and promised to take action.
