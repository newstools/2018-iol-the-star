The country has again resorted to load shedding as the power utility battles to supply electricity. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said: “From consumers’ side, we are urging them to be energy efficient by switching off all the non-essential appliances and lights when you leave the house. "Where possible also switch off geysers and turn them on after 8pm. “People who have pool pumps must change the settings so they can run late in the evening when there is no pressure on the grid.” While asking users to be more responsible, Phasiwe said it was still the power utility's duty to ensure all South Africans had access to electricity. "The responsibility of keeping the lights on falls squarely with Eskom. Eskom has to repair its generators and bring back the generators that are currently off-line. And that is the plan. We are working on it,” Phasiwe said.
