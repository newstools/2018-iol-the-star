The Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court sentenced 29-year-old Mokoena, from Soweto, to another life sentence and 35 years on Wednesday. He was also up for charges of rape, robbery with aggravating circumstances and kidnapping at the Roodepoort court. Magistrate Ruby Matthys ruled that Mokoena should be jailed for life for rape, 30 years for two counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, and five years for kidnapping. This rape also happened inside the Toyota Quantum Mokoena was hired to drive. The State proved that he raped a woman, who boarded the taxi with her 19-year-old son, on Ontdekkers Road, Florida, in March 2017. Mokoena raped the mother in the presence of the son, while the taxi drove around. Along with two accomplices, he withdrew more than R29000 with the woman’s card and robbed her and her son of their cellphones. Mokoena was linked to the rape by DNA. Last month, the South Gauteng High Court sitting in Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court sentenced Mokoena to 13 life terms and 340 years in prison. The life terms were for as many rapes, while the 340 years were for counts including aggravated robbery, kidnapping and pointing at his female victims with what resembled a gun. The 13 victims also boarded the taxi believing it was legitimate. They boarded in areas including Soweto, Freedom Park and Westdene. In his ruling, Acting Judge Cassim Moosa said Mokoena deserved no other sentence than life behind bars. “I believe there can simply be no other suitable sentenced to be imposed, having due regard to the wanton and reckless conduct of the accused,” Moosa said.
