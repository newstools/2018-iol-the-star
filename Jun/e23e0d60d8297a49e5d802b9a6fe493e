The trio who raked in thousands of rands from allegedly scamming the Financial Planning Institute of SA (FPI) exam systems are too broke to afford a private lawyer. Vusi Xaba, Zanele Xaba and Siphiwe Mhlungu, who are expelled FPI employees, are facing charges of corruption and fraud after they were arrested in May for allegedly manipulating the Wealth Management Certificate in Wealth Management exam results of 136 financial planners. The financial planners allegedly paid the trio between R3000 and R6000 for helping them pass the exams conducted by the FPI. The scam is believed to have started in 2006 before it was discovered in 2013. This after some candidates with a history of not passing the examinations suddenly passed with high marks or a set series of questions were answered in exactly the same way, claimed FPI. The three appeared at the Joburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday where they applied for legal representation from the Legal Aid Board. They were previously represented by a private lawyer in their successful bail application in May. State prosecutor Frans Mhlongo said he was aware of the financial challenges faced by the accused and told the court that he was willing to postpone the case to next month. “A new lawyer has been allocated to take over the matter. I’m asking for a July postponement because of the big size of the docket. I need some time to go through it,” Mhlongo told the court. The accused have not pleaded to the charges.@lindilesifile
