Johannesburg - Patients, doctors and nurses have been evacuated from Helen Joseph Hospital over a suspected bomb scare. Clinical manager Dr Roland Monika confirmed to The Star that a bomb squad is inside the hospital. Monika said a blue bag was found with a device and bullets. "We called the police to come and assist. At this stage I can confirm that there is a suspected bomb. A strange bag was found inside the hospital with bullets," Monika said. A nurse who asked not to be named said the bag came with a mentally-ill patient on Monday morning. "He came here and we were told to evacuate the hospital due to the suspected bomb. We don't feel safe."  Another nurse said some patients were not tended to and needed medication. She said one patient collapsed at 12pm. Mike Booysen, 61, arrived early at the hospital to get medication for lung infection. "I have been here the whole morning. I need oxygen. I can't breathe properly. This is nonsense," Booysen said. Scores of patients are waiting outside with some sleeping on their wheelchairs. Police arrived on the scene shortly after the bomb squad arrived. This is a developing story. @SthembisoMedia
