Johannesburg - The body of a man with both arms missing has been retrieved from the river where a limb was found a few days ago. Mpumalanga police said they discovered the body at about 2pm on Wednesday, three days after an arm was found floating in the Nkomazi River by fishermen. “The body, with both arms missing, was found by police divers stuck between the reeds, within a distance of approximately 200 metres upstream from where the arm was found. Police are probing how the body got in the river and lost both its limbs in the process,” spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said. A few days ago, police said they were unsure whether the arm found on June 24 “belonged to someone with albinism or has had its colour changed due to its stay in the water”. Bhembe urged members of the community who may have a missing male relative estimated to be aged between 20 and 28 who was last wearing a pair of black jeans to contact Lieutenant Colonel Lindiwe Nobunga at 082 464 6332 or the SAPS Crime Stop Line at 08600 10111. @smashaba The Star
