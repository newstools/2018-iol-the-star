Presented by The Star, the Tops at Spar Wine Show was the place to be this weekend. The uncorked fun happened at Montecasino in Fourways and showcased wine brands’ best-selling products. Du Toitskloof Selected Vineyard Series national manager Suzette Lampreche told The Star the show was a perfect opportunity to get to know their consumers. “You can never stop marketing your wine and you should never stop making contact with your consumers, which is why we’re part of the showcasing,” she said. For the first time in Joburg, the wine company brought their premium and boutique-style wines, normally not seen in stores. Lampreche said: “Our best-seller is Du Toitskloof sauvignon blanc, which is one of the top-selling brands in the country. Of all the sauvignon blancs, we are either number one or two. It varies, but we are a volume producer of the classic white wine.” The wine-tasting experience saw friends and families enjoy winemakers from Hermanuspietersfontein, South Hill and Stellenbosch Vineyards. A group of friends who spoke to The Star said the show was more than a night out with friends - it was an experience to familiarise themselves with a beverage that plays an important role in planned get-togethers. “We are always buying our favourite wines, but we never get the opportunity to try other types of brands because we are comfortable. “The WINEderland show is a perfect opportunity to learn a thing or two about what we love drinking,” said a 25-year-old teacher. The annual event saw hundreds of wines on display over the course of the three days. @Zwane_2li2ls
