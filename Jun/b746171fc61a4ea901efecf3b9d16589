Shahim Ismail, owner of Lethal Forces, has ignored several calls The Star made to him between late last week and Sunday. On the other hand, Nkosinathi Mbali’s family want answers about his death at the hands of Sydney Mischeck Banda, a Lethal Forces site manager. Banda was arrested and charged with murder more than a week ago after he fatally shot the 29-year-old Mbali who was just driving by. Banda shot Mbali just outside the China multi-complex, his workplace. Joburg central police Captain Xoli Mbele said Banda saw police chasing two suspects for theft out of a motor vehicle. He fired one shot, which missed the fleeing suspects but killed Mbali in his red Kia Picanto. On investigation, police found that the firearm Banda used was illegal. They added a charge of possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition to his case. Banda then made a statement that the firearm was his and was not issued to him by Lethal Forces. “He said he bought the firearm from someone,” Mbele said. “According to the Firearms Control Act, you’re not allowed to use your private firearm for work purposes,” he added. “The security company is obliged to issue him with a firearm belonging to the company. When he knocks off from duty, it remains locked in the company’s safe.” The police’s preliminary investigations revealed that the firearm belonged to a 48-year-old male in Kanyamazane, Mpumalanga. The family of the deceased said they wanted Lethal Forces to face the music too. Costa Diavastos, president of the Security Association of SA, said security guards can only use firearms issued to them by their employers. @BonganiNkosi87
