This pledge was made by Kevin Barbeau, executive director of Women and Men Against Child Abuse, at the launch of their #MiniMeToo campaign in Randburg on Tuesday. The campaign seeks to give children and the youth the freedom and the voice to talk about abuse that they have endured. The campaign is modelled on the #MeToo campaign in the US that was sparked by women speaking out about how men sexually harassed and even raped them. This movement led to the downfall of many sex pests, notably film producer Harvey Weinstein. It was started 10 years ago by a black woman activist in the US, Tarana Burke, with the intention to encourage “empowerment through empathy”, and recently re-emerged as a response to sexual assault claims against Weinstein by female stars. Barbeau said #MiniMeToo would raise awareness about abuse. “It was crucial to launch the movement, as the rate of child abuse is too high in our country, and something needs to be done. The more organisations and schools and the public start having these courageous conversations, the more we believe that with enough pressure we can eventually change the laws and start shifting the feelings of shame and guilt from the victims to the abusers. "Stop blaming and shaming children or adults when they disclose their abuse,” Barbeau said. Actress Enhle Mbali Maphu-
mulo and Khumbul’Ekhaya host  Andile Gaelisiwe are some of the brand ambassadors, who attended the event. Gaelesiwe has been open about her rape, which she says happened to her when she was young, and that the perpetrator was her father. Maphumulo urged South Africans to rally behind the #MiniMeToo campaign. "It's a great campaign that I feel South Africans should be a part of. This is a South African problem, a social problem. "We all need to take hold of it and drive it to the best place. There is too much abuse that has gone on for too long." Visit www.minimetoo.org for more on #MiniMeToo. @SthembisoMedia
