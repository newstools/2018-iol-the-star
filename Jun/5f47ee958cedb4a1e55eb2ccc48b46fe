Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Zille’s tweet about colonialism violated the Constitution, as they amounted to an incitement of imminent violence. In a tweet last year, Zille ignited outrage on social media when she defended certain aspects of colonialism. Western Cape ANC acting chairperson Khaya Magaxa said: “The reality of the situation that is facing the ANC, not just the DA is that  Zille, on a daily basis, is dragging the name of this province in the mud I think what we are expecting the DA to do is fire Zille. “There are a lot of capable women and men in the DA who can do better “Her tweets have impacted on the racial relations in the province. There have been consistent problems of racial attacks ever since we started this term,” said Magaxa. On the calls from the opposition to remove her, Zille declined to comment and said the DA would be the right people to provide answers. She accused the ANC of running a campaign to divide South Africans on the issue of race. “The ANC’s disingenuous campaign has been based on bots and trolls aiming to divide they know if they turn white people into the enemy, they will win elections. Former president Nelson Mandela also talked about the legacy of colonialism,” said Zille. The ANC, which filed the complaint in July last year, said it felt vindicated by the protector’s report but wanted Zille held accountable. Mkhwebane has recommended Western Cape legislature speaker Sharna Fernandez table the report before the legislature and take appropriate action against Zille. Zille said she would take Mkhwebane’s finding on judicial review.
