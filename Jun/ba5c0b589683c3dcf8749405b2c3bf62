Pay television channel SuperSport are facing another racial storm. This emerged after a letter from MVMT Attorneys on behalf of some of the black anchors and commentators accusing the channel of racism, victimisation, pay disparity and intimidation according to a report in the Sunday Times. The explosive allegations have been made by amongst others former Lions and Springbok tourist hooker Owen Nkumane, popular broadcaster and long-time SuperSport presenter Xola Ntshinga, Xhosa commentator and presenter Kaunda Ntunja and former Springboks Gcobani Bobo and Kaya Malotana. Other allegations included in the letter are discrimination, pay parity with their white colleagues, intimidation and victimisation. The anchors also claim that certain duties are “reserved for non-white pundits” while white contractors are paid more than black contractors and are expected to do more work. Independent Media contacted the anchors but none of them were willing to comment on the matter citing that it was an internal process that was being attended to by the relevant parties. The letter comes hot on the heels of the conclusion of an internal investigation which cleared analysts Nick Mallett and Naas Botha of racism after their on air altercation with former Springbok wing Ashwin Willemse. While Willemse did not testify in the investigation, he is looking at taking the matter forward to the Equility Court with SuperSport having allegedly threatened to dismiss him if he does so. “The matter is being investigated. The investigation is almost complete. SuperSport will communicate directly with the individuals concerned. No threat has been made to Ashwin Willemse,” said SuperSport’s spokesperson Clinton van der Berg told the Sunday Times. @Vata_Ngobeni  IOL Sport  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
