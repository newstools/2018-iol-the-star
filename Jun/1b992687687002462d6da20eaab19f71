Police confirmed on Thursday that four suspects were found at about 1am trying to steal electricity cables on land owned by Corobrik. The patrolling Joburg City Power security guards gave chase. Two of the suspects managed to escape and the other two ran towards a dam. SAPS spokesperson Captain Hector Netshivhodza said the deceased tried to escape capture by jumping into the water. Netshivhodza said: “When they got into the water, they sank and drowned.”  The guards alerted the police about the incident after the drowning. The SAPS arrived at the scene and called divers to extract the suspects, but because it was still dark they could not see the bodies. The police and drivers then waited until dawn to retrieve the two bodies from the artificial dam. The Star team went to the scene and saw that the dam is located on a large stretch of land that is unoccupied, except for Corobrik factories and a dumping yard. The man-made dam is said to be so deep that three buses could be stacked on top of each other and still be submerged. City Power spokesperson Sol Masolo said he was unaware of the incident. “I’ve spoken to the head of security and they don’t know anything at all about the incident you are talking about,” he said. Netshivhodza said the Lawley area experienced many  electricity outages because of cable theft. The suspects were between 25 and 30, according to the police, but their identities are unknown. No one has been arrested. @Chulu_M
