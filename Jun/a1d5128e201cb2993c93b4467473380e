Featuring eight princesses, Ariel, Belle, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Tiana, Jasmine, Aurora, Snow White and the Frozen sisters Queen Elsa and Anna, there will be a favourite for everyone. Friday night Joburgers will get to experience the Disney wonderland. “Before dreaming up this show, we reflected on what makes Disney’s leading ladies so unique. Having three daughters, it didn’t take long to realise that every princess has one thing in common: each has a dream and the determination to make it a reality. “We wanted to share that inspirational message with our audiences by celebrating the stories of these courageous young women and the friends that helped them along the way,” said show producer Kenneth Feld. Just on time for the school holidays, the show will also feature Disney favourites such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse.  Skater Jennifer Howie portrays Anastasia, one of Cinderella’s evil stepsisters, in the show. As a core skater she also performs in many other roles for different story lines. “To get a production like this on the road takes hundreds of people and months of preparation. For the skaters we do several weeks of rehearsals at the beginning of a tour and then in each city, where we get used to the ice size and our feet ready each week because every venue is a little different.” The TicketPro Dome Joburg leg of the tour ends on Sunday. The show heads to Durban’s ICC Main Arena from Wednesday July 4 to Sunday July 8. The Cape Town shows are from July 11 to 15. “We have just come from a nine-month US tour and next year we head to Europe,” said Howie, who is on his second South African tour. Disney on Ice is back in the country for the fifth time. Morgan Bell, who plays the role of the much-loved Anna from Frozen, said it was her first time in the country. “I’m loving the whole experience. It has been really cool to be here and I’m excited to share what we do, and love every day with the audience.” Ticket prices range from R152 to R480.
