A specialised task team has been appointed to track down people responsible for police killings following the murders of two officers in just three days. National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole on Monday said two more officers were killed in separate incidents. Sitole’s spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said on Monday morning, at about 5am, a 43-year-old reservist constable and a warrant officer were responding to a complaint at Section H, Ekangala near Bronkhorstspruit, Gauteng. “On arrival at the scene, the constable approached four men to make enquiries. Instead, the men fired several shots at the constable and he succumbed to his wounds. The member’s service firearm was taken,” said He said the other officer was killed on Saturday. “A police sergeant was killed when he arrived home from work at about 18:30 at Payneville, Springs. The member was off duty but still in his full uniform when he was killed. The suspects fled the scene without taking anything,” Naidoo said. Sitole has strongly condemned the “continuous callous attacks on our police officers”. "The attacks on our police officers are continuing unabated and I have reiterated to our men and women in blue not to fall with their guns. "I have also tasked that a specialised team be mobilised to track and bring those responsible to book,” said Sitole. Naidoo appealed to anyone with information that could lead to the arrest and prosecution of the suspects to contact the police on SAPS Crime stop number 08600 10111. He said callers may remain anonymous. @smashaba The Star
