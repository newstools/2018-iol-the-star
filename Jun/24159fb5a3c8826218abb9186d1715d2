Nelspruit - Mpumalanga police is seeking help in finding a body with a missing arm. Police spokesperson Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said police are requesting assistance in finding the body to which the arm belongs. “The arm was found by fishermen. It was floating in the Nkomazi River on Sunday afternoon,” said Sedibe. Sedibe said it was unclear whether the arm belonged to a person with albinism or if the colour of the arm changed due to it being in water for a prolonged period of time. He urged anyone with information that could assist police with their investigations to come forward. Sedibe said a family that has lost their loved one or has a relative with a missing arm should contact Lieutenant Colonel Lindiwe Nobungwa on 082 464 6332. @smashaba The Star
