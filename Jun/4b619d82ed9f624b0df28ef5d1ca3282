Actress and MC Mampho Brescia  What mobile phone are you currently using and when did you buy it? iPhone 7plus. I got it last year.  What makes a gadget bad and why? One that doesn’t work, it’s pretty useless then, isn’t it?  In a day, how many phone calls do you receive? Geez! It depends, but my husband calls a lot, at least five times a day, just to hear my voice.  In your voicemail message, what did you say when recording it? I don’t have voicemail; I’d rather listen to voice notes on WhatsApp.  When was the last time you received a call back? And do you call back? I think maybe years ago, and no I don’t call back. If it’s important enough you’ll make a plan.  Do you prefer listening to radio via streaming online or tuning in direct from your own radio? I only ever listen to the radio when I am driving.

If you could be a cellphone network shareholder, which company would you like to associate yourself with? Telkom, the data rates are worth it!  How much data do you think US President Donald Trump uses per week? I hardly think about him, but am sure a lot. Data is super cheap in America.  If you could send a WhatsApp message to former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, what would it be? Good one old chap, you’ve fought a long and difficult fight. Now it’s time you rest.  Do you ever do video calls? Why? Totally, with my babies. I miss them all the time.  Do you watch movies on Netflix and what are your thoughts about the streaming service? Yeah! I love Netflix, there’s just so much! Streaming and fibre, revolutionary, best thing to happen to us and the television industry. @SthembisoMedia
