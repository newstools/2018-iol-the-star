The Android family is huge, with loyalty being a big part of why people choose to stick to the same type of phone. It’s a comfort to know that you don’t have to learn how to operate the interface of a new brand when you are accustomed to the ways of another. But in a world full of Sonys and LGs, it’s refreshing to know that the choice wheel is constantly in motion. If you’re looking at a phone that can give you the needs of a smartphone but without having to dig too deep in your pockets, the Hisense Infinity F24 is the perfect device. Part of the Infinity family of phones, the F24 has 16GB of memory, a good grip, a 5.99-inch IPS display and a Google interface. The first thing I check when I get a phone is its camera quality. The 13MP on this Hisense lens just doesn’t cut it for me. There are phones with less megapixels but which take better quality pictures. The F24 has matched a lot of smartphones with its fingerprint security and screen display. Essentially, it gets the basics right and has a bold, sleek look to fit in with other smartphones. If you aren’t too fidgety and addicted to social media apps, the battery life will last for a good amount of time. The device goes for under R4000, which comes as a great relief to anyone’s hip pocket. However, if you are comparing it to other smartphones within that price range, it would be a hard sell to buy this Hisense over a better-performing Nokia or Huawei.
