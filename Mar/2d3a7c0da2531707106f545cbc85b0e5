The Great Egg Hunt for children will see them use an app to get clues and codes to find 12 eggs that will lead them to the ultimate treasure. Yesterday, DJ Arch Jnr, the youngest winner of the South Africa’s Got Talent competition, tried the hunt out ahead of the launch today. With the help of media personality Taryn Louch, the mini-DJ walked through the Geldhof Easter egg sanctuary and found some chocolate eggs in gold wrappers. The app is easy to use and will give the children clues to navigate the whole mall to unlock the codes. “The first winner to unlock all 12 codes will get a R2000 Sandton voucher and a golden ticket to the Geldhof chocolatier factory, with the other five winners also receiving prizes. “They will each win a golden egg and there will also be chocolate surprises for those who play thereafter,” Louch said The hunt proceeds through the Diamond Walk and into the Protea Court, among other focal points in the shopping mall. It’s the first time that virtual technology will be used for the Easter hunt.  The event is a prelude to the new Sandton City entertainment level that opens on April 14. “It’s everything designed for families with children. Hamleys World are launching with a carousel, a slide from the fourth floor that has a giant floor piano. It’s the biggest Hamleys in South Africa. “Ster-Kinekor is also launching its first ever Kids Only cinema.” On the day, Nelson Mandela Square will be turned into a carnival of colour with a parade, Hamleys characters and the Sandton City Cam crew. “It’s going to be lots of fun with lots of Hamleys’ beloved characters and Nickelodeon characters who will be posing for pictures with the kids.” DJ Arch will be DJing throughout the day to entertain the youngsters. This Easter egg hunt at the start of the Easter school holidays is a teaser for what is to come. This new entertainment level is going to be fun for the whole family and will set the tone for the rest of the year. @mane_mpi
