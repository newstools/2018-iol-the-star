The event took place at the Birchwood Hotel & OR Tambo Conference Centre at the weekend. Madlingozi was the main act for the night and had the audience eating out of his hand with many of his favourits, including Kum Nakum and Sondela. New group Uncuthu The Firm started the night's proceedings with an hour-long set of their music that highlights the plights of society. The four-man a cappella group sang about nyaope, the drug killing young people in the townships, as well as xenophobia and university fees. Up next was ventriloquist Chik Aljoy, who got the crowd warmed up with his monkey puppet. He also showed that his ventriloquism was not limited to just puppets when he got a member of the audience to come on stage and be his prop. Resident MC Hector Motivator was his usual jolly self, entertaining the audience as they enjoyed their three-course meal and the line-up. The Muffinz really got the night going with their Afrocentric set. Each member of the group is gifted vocally and got to show off on the night. Their renditions of Hugh Masekela’s Marketplace and Stimela’s Zwakala were a highlight of the night and got most of the audience on their feet. Comedian Sipho "Schoolboy" Ntuli used his kasi-style gimmicks to relate to the audience. The Star has partnered with the hotel and the City of Ekurhuleni for the event, and The Star marketing manager Awande Dlamini gave out some prizes on the night to four music lovers. Dineo Thulo, Sefako Molebaloa, Thobeka Mfuku and Tee Nimohola each won tickets to the upcoming Huawei Joburg Day. The next event is set for April. Will you be joining us?
