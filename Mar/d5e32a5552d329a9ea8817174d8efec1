Distress and anxiety
has struck at e.tv and eNCA studios with some staff reportedly leaving the
channels amid allegations of “constructed retrenchments”. Employees at the Hyde Park studios have told The Star that eMedia
Investments, which owns the channels, has been unfair to them by formulating
retrenchments “fronted as reconstruction”. “People are being
exploited here. The team I’ve worked with for the past three years was told
yesterday that they will not be needed by end of March but they are employed as
permanent staff. The same was done at archives and IT departments. Reporters at
eNCA are in distress. It’s a mess,” said an e.tv programme anchor. The Star has also been
told that some employees have already started packing while others have not
reported for work since the new changes were communicated. These new developments
follow the sudden resignations of the head of current affairs Debbie Meyer and
the news channel court reporter last month. It’s believed that
Meyer’s exit was sealed as part of a retrenchment deal but she has publicly
rejected this. Mark Rosin, chief
operating officer of eMedia Investments, said that they were considering making
changes that would benefit the business. 
“At times in the life cycle of a business, it is necessary to look at a
company’s needs and requirements. eMedia Investments is currently considering
its structure and making necessary changes to ensure it continues to be a
profitable and strong business,” said Rosin. However, he was cagey
and did not want to explain how these changes would impact on staff or
programming. “This is an internal
matter between the Company and employees and we will not discuss or debate it
in the media. eMedia Investments is committed to ensuring that employees are
treated fairly and respectfully during this process, which is of course
difficult for everyone,” said Rosin. @lindilesifile
