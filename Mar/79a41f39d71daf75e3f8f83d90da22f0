Woolworths has recalled a number of viennas and cold meat products after the Department of Health announced that products from an Enterprise Foods production facility in Polokwane, Limpopo, are the source of the listeriosis outbreak, which has resulted in 180 deaths. On Sunday the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said the number of laboratory-confirmed cases attributed to the foodborne disease now stood at 948 cases, with a fatality rate of 27%. According to Motsoaledi, the cases were confirmed following the government’s efforts to trace the source of the disease outbreak, which is the biggest in the country’s history. Woolworths said in a statement that it proactively manages food safety, in addition to their independent food safety testing and auditing, to prevent microbial contamination of food and that the the recall is "an additional precautionary measure".
