Johannesburg - A building at the corner of Albertina Sisulu Road and Troye Street caught fire on Tuesday morning. The building housed a number of shops and a storage unit. The Joburg Emergency Services arrived on scene shortly after the fire began and started to put it out. Passersby said they just saw smoke while they were walking to their places of work. The fire was coming from the rooftop of the building.    While firefighters were still trying to stop the fire, people started to go into the building to save some of the stock that did not burn. Some people also saw it as an opportunity to take the items that were rescued from the store and run away with them. Passersby continued to gather around and watch the firefighters extinguish the fire. The road was temporarily closed. Joburg EMS spokesperson Nana Radebe said there were no casualties reported. It is still unclear what started the fire. The Star
