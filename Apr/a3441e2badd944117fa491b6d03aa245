Lattimore made his first trip to SA in 1998. Oleta Adams toasts Joy of Jazz with new ‘Third Set’ “It was a strange time where men were raping virgins thinking they would be cured of Aids. Then I was singing about how I am ‘Never to busy’ for you baby and ‘For you’ I give a lifetime of stability.   I think women needed to hear a man say those words,” he said. The dominant age demographic of Lattimore's fans were people as young as 19 to as old a pensioners. “I found out that I had a following in South Africa when the internet was born and someone compared me to Whitney Houston and Micheal Jackson, which was amazing to me,” he said.
