According to the fashion designer, certain revolutions have started on the runway - and this season at SA Fashion Week was no different. Coenraad de Mol, the designer behind De Mil, used the collection to share a part of himself with the industry. De Mil Clothing showcased the unique collection titled The Crown, which is aimed at liberating the imagination and challenging convention. According to De Mol, the collection has become a product of a three-year spiritual journey. He said he had drawn his inspiration for hand-crafted pieces from the altar robes worn in the Roman Catholic Church. “It’s a statement collection for all those who long to express themselves,” said De Mol. The fashion industry has given a voice to some of the most brilliant, brave, creative and inspirational people throughout the ages, such as David Tlale, Thula Sindi and MaXhosa by Laduma Ngxokolo. Following in the footsteps of such designers, De Mol’s body of work was designed to honour God. De Mil was established in 1997 and moved into male-inspired, gender-neutral clothing in 2007. The designer said he did not regard gender neutrality as just a theme but as what he does. De Mol made a shift from the darker tones in his previous collections by creating bolder yet softer pieces which symbolised the shift in his life.  @Zwane_2Li2Ls
