It was a night of African trap music and milly rocking, while the bubbly flowed at the launch of rapper Emtee’s new show #Rap4Me on DStv's GauTV. Mthembeni Ndevu, better known by his stage name Emtee, hosted a launch party and announced the winning rapper for his new show at the Goliath Comedy Club at Melrose Arch in Joburg on Tuesday night. Ndevu judged and mentored aspiring rappers, with one winning a record deal with Ndevu’s record label African Trap and R100000 cash. Ten finalists from across the country participated in weeks of challenges, which culminated in an evening of the rappers performing their hearts out to a very critical crowd, including notable celebrities like KB Motsilanyane. “When I first came into the industry I had a lot of critics. People said I can’t rap and that I’m not up to it, but at the end of the day I was topping the charts. "A lot of people say I can’t rap. Okay, since you say you’re better, come rap for me and win yourself R100000,” Ndevu said about the idea behind his show. “The aim of the show is to give an opportunity to the next hip-hop sensation in South Africa. I feel like that amount of money is enough to launch one’s career,” he added. Ndevu said he was heavily involved in the decision-making for the show. He and his record-label partner Lebo created all the challenges for the contestants. As the judges, they determined the criteria for winning or losing each challenge. “This is my first show and I’m having to make a lot of decisions. It’s a big responsibility, but I can handle it." Fellow South African rapper and Ambitiouz Entertainment colleague Anele Mbisha, aka Saudi, was the special guest judge for the evening. The audience ended up deciding who would take the mantle of the winner of #Rap4Me season 1.  The Star
