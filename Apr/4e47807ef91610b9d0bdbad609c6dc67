Oh Mama, a night that set the tone for so much that has since unfolded! A night where hearts softened. this is not the time Mama! I love you today as I always have and I thank you for all you managed to say that night and the few times before. I was never in your company more than five times but each time I left with blackened cheeks from soiled mascara and a full heart! Those without sin will continue to pontificate, as for me I know that your shoulders shall continue to carry us long before we have managed to honour you in earnest with a worthy goodbye! May I grow up to be a fraction of who you are- my best self regardless of who is in the room with me💔💔💔 I am truly heartbroken and my condolences go out to your family and to our nation❤️💔🇿🇦 A post shared by Carol Bouwer (@bouwercarol) on Apr 2, 2018 at 9:26am PDT  Businesswoman Basetsana Kumalo made a video montage and a collage of Madikizela-Mandela.
