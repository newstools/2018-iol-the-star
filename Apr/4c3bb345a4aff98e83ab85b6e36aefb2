Team SA landed at the airport after putting up a sterling performance at the Commonwealth Games 2018 in Australia. “This is just to show her that I love her. You know when someone close to your heart does well, you feel mixed emotions. I am proud of her and she knows that when she does well she will be rewarded. The whole family is proud of her,” Raseboya said. Semenya raced to a historic 800m gold at the Commonwealth Games to make it a double gold, having already won and smashed a 34-year-old record in the 1500m. The track queen said she was tired, had missed her wife and was happy to be home. “I’m happy to be home, I have been waiting for this moment. “We had a great team. It is just amazing when you work with a great team. “For us to go there and be able to win two gold medals shows that we are working hard. We now master middle distance. It takes a great team to make a champion,” she said. Semenya was part of a successful Team SA that put up a great show in Australia to bring home 37 medals  -  13 gold, 11 silver and 13 bronze. Visually impaired Ndodomzi Ntutu earned a 100m gold. He said though he was happy to be home and would be back in training for the Olympics in Barcelona. “It was the first time I participated in the Commonwealth Games. For me, it is back to training for Barcelona. I have been doing athletics since I was six. “I love cricket more than I love athletics but the fact that I could not see the ball made it difficult for me to play the sport. I had to put all my focus and energy into athletics,” Ntutu said. Minister of Sports and Recreation Tokozile Xasa  said the athletes would be rewarded. “They have flown the South African flag high and we are proud of them. We told them before they left that they should do their best and they did. There will be a ceremony to honour them and the President (Cyril Ramaphosa) will also be there,” she said. @smashaba
