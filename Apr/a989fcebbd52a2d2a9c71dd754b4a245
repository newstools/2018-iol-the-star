Khloe Kardashian is reportedly living with her newborn baby daughter True by herself after she reportedly kicked her partner Tristan Thompson out following allegations that he had cheated on her while she was pregnant. The 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star - who gave birth to her daughter True just five days ago - moved her whole life over to Cleveland, Ohio, when she found out she was expecting so that she could be closer to the Cleveland Cavaliers player. But, according to People, the 33-year-old beauty has made the basketball star stay in a nearby apartment while she adjusts to life as a new mother, because she doesn't want their little one's arrival to be overshadowed by their relationship woes. However, once the doctors give her the all-clear to fly with the newborn, Khloe is reportedly planning to move back to Los Angeles, California, to be near her family. An insider said recently: "She left the hospital and is staying at Tristan's house. Khloe is waiting for doctors to tell her it's safe to fly and then she will return to Los Angeles." The curvaceous babe hit the headlines last week when video footage of Tristan appearing to lock lips with a pretty brunette in New York surfaced online. The stress of the scandal reportedly led to Khloe going into early labour with their little girl and, although she's "bitter" about his antics, she allowed him to see the birth. However, Khloe has no plans to rekindle her relationship with the sportsman and is purely focused on making sure their daughter True has a good bond with him. A source explained: "She still can't believe what happened. She is very bitter about it. "She doesn't want to be in a relationship with him. She will make sure her daughter still has a good relationship with him, though. Tristan is bonding with the baby."
