JOBURG police have this morning arrested four suspects believed to be linked to several armed robberies in the city’s northern suburbs. The four were arrested in the early hours of this morning in Diepsloot. Police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini said two police officers who raided them in their shacks were shot and wounded. “One was treated at the scene and the other was taken to the hospital in a stable condition,” Dlamini said. “Two firearms, a shotgun and a pistol, and a stolen vehicle were seized during the arrests.” The suspects, he said, would be charged with attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms and possession of a stolen vehicle. “Police are still profiling them as they may be linked to several serious and violent crimes,” he said.  The raid was conducted by the South African Police Service and the Johannesburg Metro Police officers following information on suspects involved in serious and violent crimes including mall robberies. “On arrival at one of the shacks, shots were fired at them from inside. It is where two police officers and a woman who was inside the shack were shot and wounded by the suspect. A woman and one police officer were treated by paramedics at the scene as they had sustained slight injuries,” Dlamini said. Another police officer who also sustained gunshot wounds in the left upper body was taken to Milpark hospital in a stable condition. “The suspect was later arrested and a shotgun without a serial number was seized. Three other suspects  believed to be accomplices  were also arrested and police seized a pistol and a vehicle stolen in January at Germiston,” he said. The Star
