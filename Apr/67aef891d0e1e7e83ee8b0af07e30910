Johannesburg - Former president Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane, on Thursday said he is willing to return to South Africa to "clear" his name after the National Prosecuting (NPA) announced its decision to prosecute him. Earlier on, the NPA confirmed it will charge Duduzane with homicide after a 2014 car crash that left one woman dead, spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said, reversing a previous decision not to do so. "He will be charged with culpable homicide," Mfaku said. Duduzane was given a two-month deadline that expired at the end of March to make representations as to why he should not be prosecuted, but he failed to do so, Mfaku added. In 2014, Duduzane's car rear-ended Jabulani Vusi Dlamini's minibus taxi on the M1 South off-ramp to Grayston Drive in Sandton, resulting in the death of Phumzile Dube while three other passengers were injured. The NPA in August 2015 decided not to prosecute Duduzane, despite the findings of an inquest that Zuma's son was negligent in the accident.
