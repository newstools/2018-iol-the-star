Johannesburg - Roads in and around Orlando Stadium, Soweto have been closed ahead of the official memorial service of the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Madikizela-Mandela died last week Monday at the age of 81 at the Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg. She had been in and out of hospital last year due a long illness. The memorial service had initially been planned to be held at the Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Soweto but was later relocated to the Orlando Stadium. This was due to the fact that the church does not have the capacity to accommodate many people were who expected to attend the service. Some of the roads that have been closed in anticipation of the number of people who descend into the area are Mooki Street between the Soweto Highway and Sofasonke Street as well as Klipsruit Valley Road which has been blocked off between the N17 circle and Khumalo Street. The roads will be re-opened at 6pm.    Midikizela's official Category 1 funeral will also be held at Orlando Stadium on April 14. @SthembisoMedia The Star
