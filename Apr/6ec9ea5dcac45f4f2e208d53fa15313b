The park, in the Empire-Perth transport corridor, is anchored by the Rea Vaya bus route linking Soweto to Parktown. There is large-scale densification along the route, one the cityâ€™s corridors of freedom, which is aimed at reducing the use of private transport by bringing community facilities closer to their place of residence. The upgraded facilities will offer additional sports and recreational facilities in the park, which will be done in phases. Phase one consists of constructing a new multipurpose sports and recreation centre, new and upgraded sports fields, combi-courts and parking. The second phase consists of the creation of a public square, a new library, a coffee shop, the upgraded green open space and kids' play area, and upgraded swimming pool. The project has employed seven local labourers and two SMMEs. The revamp is expected to be completed between June and August this year. JDA chief executive Christo Botes said it was co-producing solutions and meeting local socio-economic needs and mitigating challenges for the communities in Brixton and surrounding suburbs in partnership with stakeholders.
