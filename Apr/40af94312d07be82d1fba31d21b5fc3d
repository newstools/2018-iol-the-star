The SA Taxi Foundation announced on Thursday that it had given Makabela Moeletsane, from Ficksburg, a minibus taxi. Maroba Maduma, the foundation’s director, said the donation was one of their corporate social investment initiatives meant to transform the taxi industry. “The donation of a vehicle to Moeletsane serves this purpose on many levels. It gives her an opportunity to establish a business and it advances the cause of women entrepreneurs. “Moeletsane’s success will stimulate the local economy. “The minibus taxi will be a vehicle not simply for transport but social and economic mobility, enriching lives.” We are delighted to be the conduit for such organic, woman-led, community-led transformation Moeletsane has experience as a taxi owner and operator and an operating licence and permit. Maduma said she had used her savings to buy a second-hand taxi. “Not in the best of condition, the vehicle eventually became unusable and Moeletsane had to abandon her dream of being an entrepreneur, earning an independent income and being master of her own fate.” Now Moeletsane has a chance to get back in business providing transport to pupils and residents. Maduma said many pupils in Moeletsane’s community boarded near schools they were attending due to lack of transport. Moeletsane’s business would provide them an opportunity to travel between home and school. “This will preserve family cohesion and wellbeing as well as ensuring that families’ disposable income saved by this process is spent locally,” said Maduma. She will also operate in the tourism industry in Ficksburg, “carrying visitors to sites of historical and environmental significance”.“And, using a trailer, she will provide a goods delivery and collection service for village residents and businesses,” Maduma said.  @BonganiNkosi87
