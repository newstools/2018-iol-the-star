'Wedding Bashers' judge Denise Zimba seemingly threw some light shade at the Miss SA 2018 host Bonang Matheba on Sunday. During the pageant, which was held at Sun Arena in Pretoria, the 'Being Bonang' star asked Denise Zimba who she was excited to see perform during the pageant.

In case you missed it, Matheba and DJ Zinhle were friends once upon a time and their friendship came to an end due to allegations that Matheba was having an affair with DJ Zinhle's baby daddy/ex-boyfriend AKA. DJ Zinhle confirmed that the alleged affair happened when she made a blog post about the situation saying that she found out the affair a week before she was due with Kairo. It most likely was an innocent answer, but the Twitterati seems to think that Zimba was throwing some low key shade Matheba's way.
