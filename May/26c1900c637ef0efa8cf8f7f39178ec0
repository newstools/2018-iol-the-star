British pop star Mel B has admitted she always wants sex, and says there's nothing that can diminish her interest in lovemaking. The 42-year-old pop star - who divorced her film producer husband Stephen Belafonte in 2017 - has admitted to having an unquenchable appetite for sex when she's dating someone, but her desire diminishes when she's single. READ: Mel B on why she keeps mannequins in her bedroom dressed in her Spice Girls outfits The twice-married singer - who has daughters Madison, six, with Stephen, Phoenix, 19, with first husband Jimmy Gulzar, and Angel, 11, with actor Eddie Murphy - confessed: "When I'm with someone and even if I don't necessarily like them, I've got a healthy sex life. When I'm single, no." And the 'America's Got Talent' star insisted her passion for sex is completely unaffected by the stresses of relationships and parenthood. Asked on UK TV show 'Loose Women' whether there's anything that could discourage her from having sex, Mel replied: "No." Meanwhile, Mel - who split from Stephen in acrimonious circumstances last year - is currently preparing to release a tell-all book that will discuss her turbulent relationship. And the singer hopes the book will help other women who are in the midst of "toxic" relationships. Mel - who was married to the 42-year-old film producer for a decade - shared: "I'm facing a lot of ... it's like going through therapy. "Luckily, my dear dear friend Louise is helping me to write it. It's not like it's just me on a rant. I want to be able to be relatable enough where women can ... you know, feel like they're empowered. "See, if they are in a bad relationship or they are a bit traumatised or feel trapped, or it's toxic or unhealthy, you can get out. "I mean, it took me nearly ten years to get out - but I got out. And I'm happier."
