Kylie Jennerâ€™s daughter Stormieâ€™s paternity is reportedly in question, again. This time it is alleged thatÂ her bodyguard Tim Chung is Stormiâ€™s real father. According to the reports, Travis Scottâ€™s, mother, Wanda Webster, is demanding a paternity test after a photo of Kylieâ€™s bodyguard went viral on social media. The photo compares Stormieâ€™s picture with that of Chung's, against snaps of Stormie with Travis Scott. On Monday, an online music platform Hip Hop Heads tweeted: "Travis Scott's mother reportedly demands paternity test after Kylie Jenner bodyguard photo goes viral"     Travis Scott's mother reportedly demands paternity test after Kylie Jenner bodyguard photo goes viral pic.twitter.com/z4Dfnc0ckT â€” Hip-Hop Heads (@HipHopHeads) May 7, 2018  See how fans reacted to the allegations:     pic.twitter.com/ALIMoJ07YX â€” .

Kylieâ€™s ex-boyfriend Tyga - whom she split from in April last year, also suggested that the two-month-old tot belongs to him, but later retracted the claim. IOL
