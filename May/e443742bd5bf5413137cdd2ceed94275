The sheet metal hoarding has been on the pavement of Albertina Sisulu and Simmonds streets for the past seven years, forcing pedestrians in the busy CBD to walk in the streets. Property owners in the area have been calling on the city for years to get something done about it. Jan Nel from the development company, Urban Ocean which owns several nearby buildings, said the sheeting “looks atrocious and creates a negative effect for the city”. “It is obvious that construction is not taking place at the building and the continuous and indefinite fencing should not be allowed. The view from our buildings towards the applicable site is not acceptable. “It should further be noted that the fence/hoarding is obstructing traffic. It is evident that various other buildings owned by the government in the CBD are neglected and that the City is not interested in rectifying and or cleaning the immediate and surrounding area." Nel said many streets in the CBD which were not being cleaned by property owners, were a complete mess, with broken bins and potholes. The City, in correspondence seen by Metrowatch, said the building officer had  been on site on April 26 and May 7 and an order had been issued to the Gauteng province to remove the hoarding. The Gauteng provincial government did not respond to a request for comment.
