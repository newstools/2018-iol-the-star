Khloe Kardashian took to social media to share a snap of her baby girl True to mark the one-month milestone of her birth. The reality star was "social media silent" after a video of her NBA star boyfriend cheating on her circulated online just days before she was due to give birth, so when she made a social media comeback by sharing a video of True, people lost their minds as they "cooed and aahed" over the freckled-facedÂ beauty. Now it was obvious that Khloe used a filter on her video, as True had a frangipani flower "in her hair", but what stood out the most was her gorgeous little freckles.     ðŸ’•Happy One Month True ðŸ’• A post shared by  KhloÃ© (@khloekardashian) on May 12, 2018 at 5:37am PDT One fan wrote in comments section: "What a BLESSING !!! Those freckles ( Angel kisses ) are so cute ! Beautiful (sic). But what left me shook was the picture Khloe shared of her and her baby girl on Sunday, using the same filter, and the freckles were suddenly on her face and no longer True's.

And I wasn't the only one who noticed. One fan wrote: "May we please see the child with no filter?"
