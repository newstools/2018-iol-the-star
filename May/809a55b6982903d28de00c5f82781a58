Last week, the council took a decision to mandate its section 79 committee on community development to begin a process to determine an appropriate manner through which to honour the Struggle icon. The original report was amended before tabling it in the council, to ensure that the process would be consultative, with councillors from all the political parties participating. This would be done to ensure that the process transcends party politics. Mayor Herman Mashaba said in taking the decision to formally honour Mama Winnie, who was a proud resident of Soweto, the council had noted she spent her life as a pro-poor warrior fighting the injustices of apartheid. “The unanimous nature of support in the council for this decision is a tribute to her legacy that transcends all political parties in the country,” Mashaba said. - Anna Cox
