Surgeries were conducted with caution at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital after the oxygen in oxygen ranks ran out. The oxygen ran out on Thursday but operations were later restored in the evening. Oxygen tanks allocated to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), surgery theaters and some wards at the hospital ran out due to a fault in the system of the oxygen supplier Afrox. The company's system had allegedly initially reflected that there were 30 tons of oxygen left in the tanks however the internal system alarmed that there was a shortage of oxygen. According to the hospital’s acting CEO, Dr Sifiso Maseko, oxygen cylinders were then used as a backup for the problem. “It’s a mistake to say that there was no oxygen supply because we still receive oxygen but from the cylinders, not from the Afrox tanks,” said Maseko. This was after DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC Jack Bloom sent out a statement saying that the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital ran out of oxygen in surgery theaters resulting in the cancellation of 20 non-emergency operations. “It is inexcusable that this could happen as oxygen is essential and should always be available. In that case, services continued with caution.” The Star contacted Bloom and according to him, he was informed that operations continued last night. “Doctors keep telling me that if it’s not one thing, it’s another and it’s not a small thing, if you don’t have oxygen then you can’t do the operation.” Dr Maseko said by the evening, Afrox had sent three trucks of oxygen tanks to the hospital to rectify the mistake. He said the hospital management met with Afrox on Friday morning and they have were committed in apologising. “We hope that they’ll give us a technical report because we don’t believe in a playing game, they need to do a serious resource analysis. We have a backup system that served us well yesterday but it’s just a backup system,” said Dr Maseko. @Chulu_M
