Jali, 28, was released on Sunday after spending Saturday night behind bars at Brooklyn police station. Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said “a 28-year-old former Orlando Pirates player playing for the national soccer team had been detained. “He was released on bail of R1000 bail and the court date was set for May 15, 2019.” Mahamba then explained the delay before the court appearance. “When we arrest you, first we breathalyse you, which tells us there is a possibility of alcohol in your system. Then we draw blood and take it to the laboratory for evidence in court. The results may take up to a year,” Mahamba said. The Belgium-based Jali was arrested while driving his personalised “Jali 15 GP” white Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT in Hatfield, Pretoria. - African News Agency (ANA)
