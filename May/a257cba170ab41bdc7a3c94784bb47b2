In case we forgot how she earned this title, her elegance at the Sun Arena in Pretoria on Sunday served as a worthy reminder. The 30-year-old stunned in four breathtaking outfits, of which three were from Fouad Sarkis Couture. On the website, the designs are described as "garments that never dress to impress, but rather dress to create". Women step into their creations and discover a new self. "We dare them to be different, because we believe in them,” their motto says. Matheba, who is bold in her outfit choices, reflected this essence at the pageant. The first was a red show-
stopper from the 2016 Fouad Sarkis collection. The fiery off-the-shoulder number wowed the audience, with former Miss South Africa  Adè van Heerden remarking that Matheba looked like a contestant vying for the crown. Matheba also went international with her artistic butterfly headpiece from Odd Commodities in New York. The brand is known for its intricate pieces, such as the custom feather-and-orchid headpiece it created for Winnie Harlow at this year’s Met Gala. For the next part of the Miss SA pageant, Matheba had already changed into a gold and black sheer Steven Khalil creation. Khalil, a leading designer in Australia, designed the dress for his 2018 couture collection at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Australia. According to the website, his designs are renowned for their elegance and beauty, combining classical elements of bygone eras with a contemporary edge. Matheba next donned a blush-pink embroidered Fouad Sarkis gown. She made her final fashion statement in a dazzling blue gown from the Fouad Sarkis Couture collection, before announcing this year's Miss South Africa. She complemented the sweetheart neckline with dramatic earrings from Helen Yarmak. Matheba's fashion flair is always a hot topic of discussion, and this was no exception. @mane_mpi
