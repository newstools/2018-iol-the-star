Johannesburg - A manhunt is on for nine armed men who brazenly blocked the N4 west near Akasia during broad daylight and attacked a cash van. In a graphic video circulating on social media the robbers can be seen collecting money on the ground while two people believed to be security guards lay next to the vehicle. More than five men can be seen moving around the cash van. They move away from it, then a few seconds later there is an explosion and they move back to it and start collecting all the notes that are scattered all over the ground. As this is happening, motorists travelling on that road stop their vehicles and look on. Another motorist reverses after realising what is going on. Captain Mavela Masondo told The Star it was alleged that the suspects shot at the security guards with rifles forcing it to stop.     “After it had stopped they forced the three security guards out of the car and blew up the vehicle with explosives. An undisclosed amount of cash was taken,” said Masondo. No injuries were sustained during the robbery. The police confirmed that the gang was seen driving two Audi A4s; one blue and one grey. Police have appealed to anyone who has information about the incident to report to the nearest police station. The Star
