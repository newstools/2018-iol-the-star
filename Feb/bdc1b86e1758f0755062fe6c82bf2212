The city says that drowning is still one of the most common causes of accidental death in children and being able to swim is an essential lifesaving skill. The city, in partnership with Eastern Gauteng Aquatics and the Gauteng Department of Education, launched a fully-functional “Learn to Swim” container at Nkabinde Primary School in KwaThema on Friday. The container pool is a standard shipping container which has been converted into a swimming pool. This pool is transportable and movable 
and ,therefore, it can be installed 
at any location where it is 
desired. Ekurhuleni spokesperson Themba Gadebe said that in broadening access to swimming pools, the city has allocated funding in the current financial year to accelerate the implementation of free water safety programmes across the region. “The free, fun and safe swimming lessons target children from Grades 1 to 3 and are run by Ekurhuleni lifeguard officials, as well as Eastern Gauteng Aquatics instructors,” he said. A total of seven schools are part of the programme with close to 2000 participants who use the Actonville, Alberton, Benoni, Leondale, Reiger Park and Vosloorus swimming pools. “The lessons are run with children from selected schools and the city is optimistic that such initiatives will expand further, ensuring that more children are water safe and pique an interest in swimming to minimise drowning incidents,” said Gadebe.
