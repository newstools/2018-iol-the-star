Rabalago appeared at the Mookgophong Magistrate’s Court flanked by three congregants who claimed he had healed them using “Holy Doom” insecticide. The courtroom was filled to capacity and there was disappointment that sentencing was postponed to next week. The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities had welcomed the decision pronounced in 2017 by the Limpopo High Court which ordered Rabalago to stop using the insecticide on his congregants. He had also been charged with assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm for using Doom on the sick. Magistrate Frans Mahodi asked the accused if he had a lawyer and he responded that his lawyer was ill. The trial was adjourned for 20 minutes. His lawyer then called the prosecutor, Chris Maruma. “His attorney said he was sick and I told him to come here sick, and he then told me that he did not have spectacles and that he ordered a pair which would only arrive on Friday. "Therefore he would not be able to read the small fonts without his spectacles,” Maruma told the court.
