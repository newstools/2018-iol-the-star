Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba in partnership with City Power‚ launched an electrification of the Slovo Park informal settlement during a sod-turning event on Monday. Mashaba who addressed a marquee full of local residents apologised for delaying to provide electricity. "There is nothing to celebrate in giving you electricity 23 years later. I would like to apologise on behalf of the new democracy for failing you," said Mashaba.    The Slovo Park informal settlement - located next to the Nancefield industrial area‚ close to Eldorado Park and Soweto is home to over 4‚000 informal households. Mashaba announced that over 1000 shacks will be directly electrified. The mayor said they are working hard to ensure that they electrify the whole location. "Let us work. I will ensure that I get status and weekly reports about the progress here," said Mashaba. Local residents were pleased of the first phase of the electricity roll out. Belina Mkwanazi who has lived at Slovo Park since 1996, says she is happy that they are finally getting electricity.
