Those who went to the show expressed their joy on social media. Mary Metcalfe called the musical a stunning production that was both tearful and joyful, while Mpho Nakana said the production was well done with a talented group of people. Based on the novel written by Alice Walker, the South African musical version is directed by the acclaimed Janice Honeyman. Didintle Khunou, in her first major theatre role, stands out in her role as Celie and mesmerises the audience with her acting and singing capabilities. Writing in the official booklet of the musical, Oprah Winfrey, said: “It makes me so very proud to know that the musical version of The Color Purple has finally arrived on stage in South Africa. “I first read Alice Walker’s novel more than 30 years ago and immediately understood it would be a powerful, ongoing force in my life. Nearly two years after I discovered the book, Quincy Jones and Steven Spielberg gave me the opportunity to play the role of Sofia in the feature film version. That turned out to be not only my big screen debut, but also one of the greatest experiences of my life.” She added that there was no better time for the story to be told in South Africa. “I invite you to experience the musical with the hope that The Color Purple will bring as much joy to your life as it has brought to mine.” Starring Lerato Mvelase and Aubrey Poo, The Color Purple will run until March 4. Tickets start from R240. Read the entertainment section for an in-depth review.
