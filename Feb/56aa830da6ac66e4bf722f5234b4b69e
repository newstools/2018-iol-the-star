The City of Joburg’s Environmental Health Department led a Listeriosis awareness campaign at Bara Taxi Rank on Monday.
 
The campaign comes at a time when South Africa is facing the challenge of an increase in the number of reported cases and deaths resulting from the infection.
 
Member of the Mayoral Committee, Dr Mpho Phalatse, distributed pamphlets and inspected food outlets around the rank.
 
MMC Phalatse spoke about the importance of fighting Listeriosis. “It was important that we come to Bara Taxi Rank, a Soweto transport hub, to talk to our people about the dangers posed by Listeriosis. We are not going to win this fight if we don’t involve communities and take the campaign directly to them,’’ Phalatse said.
 
According to the City, “as of this month the number of deaths now stands at 139 across the country, with Johannesburg recording a total of 235 cases and 26 deaths.”
 
Last week, the City of Joburg said it had discovered listeria in an eatery.
 
The head of the centre for enteric diseases at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Dr June Thomas, said the presence of listeria did not mean the food was dangerous especially in uncooked food like meat and chicken. “There has unfortunately been a lot of misinformation around the testing of listeria. There are certain types of food that you commonly do find listeria on, but they don’t necessarily pose a risk. “The biggest example of this is raw chicken. Often when you test chicken, you can find listeria there but it doesn’t pose a great health risk because you are going to cook it before you eat it. Nobody eats chicken sushi,” said Thomas.
