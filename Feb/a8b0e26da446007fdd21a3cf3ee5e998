 A 32-year-old property owner who owes the City of Joburg R900 000 in rates and services has been arrested for attempting to bribe an official with R5000. Mayor Herman Mashaba said the man was arrested yesterday in Mayfair for attempting to bribe a team leader of Operation #BuyaMthetho. “The suspect was arrested by the South African Police Services (SAPS) working together with the City’s Group Forensic and Investigation Service. The suspect is detained at the Johannesburg Central Police Station. He will appear at Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday, February 19,” Mashaba said. Operation #BuyaMthetho was launched last week and has seen the City’s technicians disconnecting water and electricity supply to properties that are in arrears and those that have illegally connected the services. “I have been informed that the suspect’s property owes the City R900 000 for rates and services.  When the team arrived at the said property they found that the electricity was illegally connected.  It is alleged that the suspect then offered the team leader R5 000 in order for him not to disconnect the power supply. “A trap was then set up and the suspect was arrested after paying the R5000 bribe to the official,” Mashaba said. He said since the launch, seven people have been arrested for illegally reconnecting services that was previously cut off. “Instead of coming forward and making payment arrangements, some residents approach our officials to illegally reconnect their services. I have instructed the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department  to monitor these properties and ensure that services are not illegally reconnected at these sites.  If they are reconnected the owners will be arrested immediately. “I have every faith that the JMPD, working with our law enforcement partners, will do all it can to ensure lawbreakers are held to account.,” he said.
