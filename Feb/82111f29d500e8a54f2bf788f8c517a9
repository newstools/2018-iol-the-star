Johannesburg - A new traffic-calming system, to be introduced on busy roads in Johannesburg, involves “choking” up some main roads, which could force a change in motorists’ behaviour. The system has been implemented on the corner of Eastwood Road and Jan Smuts Avenue in Dunkeld. The Johannesburg Roads Agency has narrowed the dual-carriage road to one lane so only one vehicle can pass at a time. JRA spokeswoman Bertha Peters-Scheepers said this the traffic calming application was called a “choker”. This is the name given to “build-outs” added onto a road to narrow it. “There are various configurations of chokers," she explained, "but the philosophy is to narrow a road to change its perception to drivers. "This effectively reduces road width such that motor vehicles approaching from opposite directions will slow to pass, or stop, to allow the other driver to pass, and is intended to reduce motor vehicle speeds and cut-through traffic.” The installations were designed by WSP Consulting Engineers in consultation with the home-owners and developers in Dunkeld, she added, in an effort to reduce the impact of the planned commercial development located along Dunkeld on the residential streets.
A similar form of chokers (called chicanes) have been installed in Meadowlands. The Star
