Johannesburg - The families of two metro police officers killed when an allegedly drunk driver rammed into a roadblock in Paulshof, Joburg, on Monday night visited the accident for the first time on Thursday. Winnie Mokholo, 35, and Sophie Ngoasheng, 45, were declared dead at the scene following the accident. Mokgolo's aunt Gloria Mokgolo said, "It hurts. She was a breadwinner."

Emotions ran high, with family members crying uncontrollably. "Go well my grandchild," said a family member as she placed a rose in front of two silver crosses placed where the accident happened.
