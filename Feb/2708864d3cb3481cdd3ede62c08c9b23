Several #ZumaMustGo and #HandsOffZuma protesters are still gathered outside Luthuli House where police have maintained a visible presence. Thabang Setona, who is the ANC branch secretary of Ward 62 says if the Black First Land First (BLF) wants the president of the county, they must go to Union Buildings. He says "here we have the president of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa." BLF announced last week that they will lead a "Hands off Zuma" demonstration, calling for President Jacob Zuma to be allowed to serve out his term. Catch up on more of this story here: Setona says "We hope that those who will be marching won't provoke us. BLF are not members of the ANC. We are here to defend the ANC headquarters and its leadership.”    One of BLF members was seen running away after being chased by #DefendANC supporters. Police had to intervene and bring calm.    ANC's communications manager Khusela Diko says The ANC has not received any formal notification of any marches to Luthuli House.” “The ANC has not received any formal notification of any marches to Luthuli House, we trust that any grouping intending to march today has the necessary permissions in line with the law and regulations. We further urge such grouping to ensure that necessary measures relating to the deployment of public order officials and emergency services have been complied with.” Diko says ANC leaders will be meeting later today and they will send someone to receive a memorandum.     Streets around the ruling party’s headquarters have been closed. Follow @ReporterStar for live updates.   @SthembisoMedia
