The Rolex Gang seems to be more brazen in their attacks if a recent video of a robbery purporting to be committed by the gang is anything to go by. The video was posted on activist Yusuf Abramjee’s Twitter account and the incident is alleged to have happened outside Da Vinci Hotel in Sandton. In the video, captured on Saturday August 25, a woman and the hotel’s porter are busy unloading bags from the back of a car parked in front of drop off, pick up point of the hotel while a man in blue jeans and a red sweater is standing by.    There are other people not far from the car who seem to be waiting for vehicles to pick them up. Another man in a striped shirt and jeans, approaches from the front of the car and chats to the man in the red sweater. He stands at the boot to help the lady as well as the man in the red sweater. While the three of them are concentrating on removing the luggage, a gunman approaches, running towards them. The three are startled by the gunman and the two men start moving backwards, away from the car. As they move back, they walk into the gunman’s accomplice and the two robbers then force the two men to take off their watches. After the robbery, which happened in a few seconds, the men casually walk away away but then start running and getting  into a waiting white vehicle. As they get away, their victims watch them helplessly. While there are a number of people outside, no one comes to the victims’ rescue.  According to twitter user @gennachasecloud "they robbed Bellinis in Illovo yesterday also for a Rolex". The Star  tried to get a comment from Da Vinci Hotel but was told that the general manager was the only one who could speak on the matter but was not available.
