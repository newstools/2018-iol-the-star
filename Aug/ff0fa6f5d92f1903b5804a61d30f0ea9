The 10-track album celebrates Dixon’s journey in music. The chart-topping producer, whose real name is Mabi Ntuli, said the celebration of his milestone was about moving 10 steps forward. “The body of work is actually painting a picture of South African house music over the last decade. The different sub-genres and influences that have come my way as a DJ and the different sounds that have resonated with the nation as a whole,” he said. At an exclusive listening session held at Joburg City Auto, the platinum-selling producer invited close friends, family and members of the media to get a taste of his latest offering. The album features the likes of DJ Tira, J Something, Donald, Nolwazi and Kwesta. The 33-year-old took South African airwaves by storm in 2014 with the release of his hit-single City Rains, which featured M.que. Since then, he has released smash hits such as Love Colour Spin, Trigger, Ezizweni and Bhutiza. Though Dixon is known as a producer, a fun fact about this album is that he was able to tap into his vocals, which isn’t a common occurrence. The Bhutiza hit-maker told The Star that supporters can grasp from the album that he is versatile. “It’s a build-up. It starts you off slowly with a more soulful, deeper kind of sound.” The maestro has made it no secret that his favourite track on the album is Please Me, featuring J Something. Dixon’s album launches on Friday in stores and on all digital platforms. @Zwane_2li2ls
