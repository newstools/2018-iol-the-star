Follow the drama as in each episode four strangers are wined, dined and entertained in each other’s homes in a bid to win the weekly R10 000 prize. While it’s the effort and attention to detail shown in the food, décor, entertainment and overall hosting skills that gets the votes, often the clash of personalities and tastes has a dramatic and hilarious role to play in the outcome of the evening. The critically acclaimed hit, Come Dine With Me South Africa, will once again be filmed in Gauteng, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban, giving audiences a taste of what each area has to offer. Season 4 saw a lot of funny moments, scrumptious food, kitchen mishaps and most importantly interesting characters, who had these useful tips for the next set of potential contestants.       Featuring the wry observations of voice-over legend Dave Lamb, entertaining characters, sumptuous cuisine and lekker local humour, Come Dine With Me South Africa season five is looking to be even more exciting than ever with some surprise elements in store for contestants. #ComeDineSA, www.bbcsouthafrica.com, @BBCBRITSA.
