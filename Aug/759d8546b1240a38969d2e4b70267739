SA Express (SAX) has announced that it will resume its operations next week Thursday.  This follows the recent reinstatement of both the airline’s Air Operator’s Certificate (AOC) and Aircraft Maintenance Organisation (AMO) licences by the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA).  According to SA Express, the airline already received Certificates of Airworthiness for most of its 11 aircrafts from SACAA, with the remaining fleet expected to be given the green light soon.  SAX Interim CEO, Siza Mzimela said she was pleased with the latest developments.  “We are delighted that we have now satisfied the concerns that the regulator had leading to our temporary grounding at the end of May this year. This has paved the way for us to prudently and incrementally reintroduce our flights as from August 23, 2018.  Mzimela said they were more determined.  “Indeed, our temporary grounding was an opportune time for the airline to interrogate all aspects of our operation, as well as our customer value proposition.  “It’s all systems go now and we are coming back stronger, more focused and energised. In this regard, we are determined going forward to set new industry standards for safety, product quality and customer service.” she said.  The airline had its permits revoked when SACAA  found that its maintenance section had severe cases of non-compliance, something that posed serious safety risks for passengers, resulting in nine planes being grounded.  SA Express passengers can now be able to book flights on www.flyexpress.aero for travel.
