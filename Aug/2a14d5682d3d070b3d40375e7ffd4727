Embassy Lounge hosted its launch on July 27 with a performance by Mobi Dixon. But then it failed to pay employees who were hired in the first few days. The club’s former resident DJ, Mpho Ngwenya, said he could tell that they were not ready for the opening. “Everything happened so fast. We didn’t have the necessary things like speed points for people to pay,” he said. “The stock came in late. We ran around like headless chickens.” Ngwenya said they were not prepared that day because the owner, Pumlani Mbeki, didn't know what he was getting himself into. When it was time for the staff of about 15-20 people to be paid, more problems arose. “The staff who were working with us were supposed to get paid. Pumlani fired some staff , but didn’t pay them." Ngwenya said the staff still employed had also not been paid. A 22-year-old waitress, who is also studying, said they had a verbal agreement that they would be paid commission, but it then changed to an hourly payment of R20 for a 12-hour shift. But that didn’t happen. Mbeki said hostesses who worked on the opening night were paid. He said other payments were performance-based, and that there seems to have been miscommunication by some recruiters. @Chulu_M The Star
