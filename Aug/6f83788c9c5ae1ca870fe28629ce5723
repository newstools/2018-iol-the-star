 How has technology affected and influenced musicians? Technology has made it easier to communicate with the world. Artists don’t have to be in the same studio to collaborate. For DJs, they no longer have to drag around vinyl.  How do you use technology to stay relevant in the music industry? With my LOGIC Music Programmes, this is easy. I get automatic updates.  How has new technology had an impact on music festivals, and how are festivals changing? It’s no secret that technology has had a huge impact on our day-to-day lives, from the way we capture and share content online, to the way we communicate with friends and family on the other side of the world. And with the rising popularity of social media and mobile phones, it was only going to be a matter of time before technology impacted the way millennials experience music festivals.  Do you have a power bank? Damn. I keep losing them. I think I had five of them.  Do you use a USB to listen to music in your car, or a CD player? I use USB.  Would you buy Beats Studio3 Wireless Headphones? Yes, I would.  Have you ever used eWallet? I use it all the time.  Which smartphone are you using? iPhone 5.  If you could make a video call to one international actress, who would it be? It may not be an international actress - but it would be nice to call up old friends/artists I have worked with and hung out with before. Lauryn Hill - Worked with her back in Prophets of Da City Days, in Europe. Kerry Hilson - I took her around Soweto and JHB during the 2010 World Cup. @SthembisoMedia
