The family would like to give thanks to Allah and appreciation to all those who gave their support during this difficult time” “The family is greatly relieved that he is back, but there’s a long road ahead and we would like to appeal to the public and the media to respect the family’s privacy at this time,” reads the statement. The Star tried to get comment from the SAPS, but was told that “we will get back to you.” At this stage, there are no details of Gathoo’s condition, where he had been kept and whether there was any ransom paid for his release. It was reported at the time of his kidnapping that he was pulled from his vehicle and shoved into another one by his alleged abductors. @SthembisoMedia
