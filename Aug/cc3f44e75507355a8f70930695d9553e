Different labour unions were to march to Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital on Monday over alleged corruption at the institution which they claim has crippled healthcare services Members of the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (DENOSA), the Health & Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa (HOSPERSA), the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (NEHAWU), the National Union Of Public Service and Allied Workers (NUPSAW) National Public Service Workers Union (NPSWU) and the Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) were expected to march to the hospital. The said they would be demanding the release of the “long-held report of investigation over rife corruption at the hospital, which has crippled healthcare service at the facility to the ground for far too long” According to the organiser Yandisa Zungula, this action follows numerous tea-breaks and lunch-hour pickets at the hospital by workers who have had to render compromised service at the facility to patients. “The march will demand, among other things the acting CEO to step down; corrupt officials to be removed; the release of the investigation report; filling of vacant posts and fair employment opportunities for everyone. The results of corruption at the hospital have led to what has become sub-standard healthcare at the facility to patients." Zungula also said service malaise at the hospital had manifested itself in the following ways: - Rampant corruption over employment -Interference of the Acting CEO in the employment process to ensure certain officials are employed -Intimidation of other senior managers and the taking of unilateral decisions within their departments -Severe shortage and misappropriation of staff which compromises the quality of care -Shortage of cleaners, theater operators and other health workers  -Lack of capacity in security -Outstanding payments of staff benefits.  -Gross shortage of staff at Maternity Ward “And, unfortunately, patients die,” Zungula said. Spokesperson for the Gauteng Department of Health, Lesemang Matuka said the department  has launched an investigation into all matters the unions raised. However, he said, it was unfortunate that while the department was looking at their demands within the agreed time frame sporadic picketing has been happening at the hospital. “In the meantime the department is doing everything to ensure that service is not disrupted,” he said.
