This weekend, the former YOtv presenter and radio host will launch her GRL PWR series to bring women from all walks of life together. “I actually had a networking platform for my peers at varsity who wanted to get into the working world, because in my life that is where I found myself at the time. “It was called Pink Thursdays and I met every last Thursday of the month.” But as life progressed, the now 28-year-old stopped the sessions and started to build her own brand. “Now that I’m getting older, I’m embracing my voice and my strength as a woman. It’s always been something I have been passionate about I just needed to get to a point where I could help others.” The GRL PWR series will see actress Terry Pheto; Sony Music Africa marketing director Aisha Mohamed; personal trainer and adidas ambassador Mapule Ndhlovu; Design Essentials marketing director Zoe Dhlembeu; and Y Her co-creator and Amazi chief business officer Katleho Tsoku talk to women about their journeys. “I started this project, after I put myself in young girls’ shoes. “When I was between 16 and 20, I wished I had a platform like this that allowed me to prepare for the future. At school, they only teach the theory and not the practical. “It’s encouraging to have women share their journeys to empower each other and ensure your vision comes alive,” she said. Women often face challenges that make them question their abilities, Voster said. “When you hear other women talk about how they got over their challenges, it helps give your visions clarity. “For many young women, a conversation can change your lives; we are sometimes insecure about our dreams, because of how we were brought up, allowing other people to speak first while we remain silent.” She said she wanted to inspire young women to strive for and achieve their dreams.
