Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela told The Star that they would be will be investigating the circumstances around the incident. “At the moment what we know is that there was a fight where he shot the girlfriend, shot the uncle and shot himself. The uncle is in hospital. “We don’t know the motive of the incident. We are investigating. A case of murder and inquest has been opened as well as a case of attempted murder,” he said. Makhubela urged women to report any incidents of abuse. “The important thing is that if people have issues in terms of domestic violence, that matter must be reported to the police as soon as possible rather than to wait for such a tragedy.” @SthembisoMedia The Star
