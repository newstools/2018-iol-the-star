Deputy Director-General for Clinical Services, Dr Richard Lebethe is the newly appointed acting CEO for Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. Gauteng Health Department introduced Lebethe to the workers as acting CEO and he took on his position with immediate effect. He will be holding the fort until the finalisation of the ongoing investigations of the allegations raised by respective labour unions at the Soweto hospital. Dr Sifiso Maseko was dismissed on Monday for alleged corruption and exploitation of women with his delegates. Investigations regarding these allegations are on going. "The allegations made are being taken seriously and to this effect, the Department instituted an independent investigation to ensure the process is fair and transparent,” said the Head of Department, Professor Mkhululi Lukhele. The Department is still committed to engage with stakeholders and resolve their concerns. It has petitioned the final court order to put a stop to disruptions of essential services to patients and allow the investigations to proceed without disturbances. Unions that had been protesting against claims leveled on the former acting CEO and his delegates are satisfied with the new improvements. Speaking to The Star on Thursday, Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa’s (Denosa) spokesperson Yandisa Zungula said the workers welcomed the appointment. “Currently we are happy, services are running smoothly at the hospital and we are looking forward to the investigation results,” said Zungula.
