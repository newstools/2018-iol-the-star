Ebony Park clinic was revamped for R45 million and will by next week be handed over to the Health Department.  The eco-friendly clinic will be handed over by Joburg Development Agency (JDA).  “This project is part of the broader City of Johannesburg Health Infrastructure Upgrade Programme, which is aimed at improving access to basic health services for the residents of the City of Johannesburg,” said JDA CEO Christo Botes. The clinic is equipped with the latest technological innovations such as the peak photo-voltaic system, which generate electrical power from solar panels reducing operational costs and minimising on the carbon footprint of the development.​ It also includes standby electrical power supply which allows continuity of power supply to some critical areas during power outages within the facility. Further innovations includes LED lighting systems where practical, which allow for a lower energy consumption, lower maintenance costs compared to conventional lighting and as a result reduced operational costs. The clinic is located at the corners of Archerfish Avenue and Mudhopper Street, Ebony Park in Midrand. It consists of emergency wing, TB and ARV departments, waiting area, antenatal care unit, new waiting areas, medical dispensary, and parking for staff and visitors. It will improve and expand patient access to medical services, improved lifestyle, and provide jobs for the community in Ebony Park and surroundings neighbourhoods. The Star
