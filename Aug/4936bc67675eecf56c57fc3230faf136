One person has allegedly been shot dead in White City, Soweto during a clash between locals and foreign nationals. Soweto West police spokesperson Sergeant Khalipha Mvula said he could not confirm that someone was shot after a foreign nation opened fire in self-defence when locals tried to loot his shop. Gauteng SAPS spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said he believes the altercation between the locals and foreign nations was sparked by the article that was published in The Star about foreign owned spaza shops who sell fake and expired good. “That’s the whole thing that sparked this so the people are attacking these shops,” said Dlamini. Mvula said the situation was still very tense in White City and the police are waiting for additional enforcements to arrive. “One shop just got looted and we will continue to monitor the situation,” said Mvula. Despite neither Mvula nor Dlamini confirming the killing, Captain Mpande Khoza confirmed on Radio 702 that someone had indeed been shot and killed in the mayhem. Some foreign nationals who own shops in area were seen packing and leaving their shops.       This is a developing story. Follow our reporter @Zwane_2Li2Ls for live updates.
