An on-duty security guard had to be airlifted to hospital after being shot and robbed of his firearm in Benoni. This happened on Sunday night near the Apex railway station on Wolverhampton Street. Allegations are that the 32-year-old man was cornered by a group of men who shot him and robbed him of his firearm. He was by himself when he was attacked. According to Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst, they arrived at the scene at 21H39 and treated the man on the scene. “Due to the nature of his injuries the Netcare 1 Specialised Helicopter Air Ambulance was called in to airlift the patient who was in a critical condition to the hospital,” Herbst said. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela confirmed to The Star that a case of attempted murder and robbery has been opened but did not elaborate further. It's understood that the man worked for a security company that had been subcontracted by Metrorail and was guarding the freight company's property at the time. The Star tried to get a comment from Metrorail's Lillian Mofokeng but was unsuccessful. Last week, angry commuters attempted to burn a train at Naledi Station on Friday morning but ended up damaging 15 cars belonging to Metrorail crew at the depot. As a result, the Naledi train line was suspended until Sunday. @SthembisoMedia The Star
