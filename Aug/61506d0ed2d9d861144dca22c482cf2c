Joburg residents have been warned to be on the lookout for people carrying false City Power identity cards and trying to gain access to properties. Spokesperson Isaac Mangena said City Power had become aware of the impostors and fraudsters who were attempting to rob the community by producing fake identification cards claiming to be employees. “City Power is warning residents not to allow any person, technician or contractor into their property without first verifying their credentials with City Power if in doubt,” he said. Members of the public were advised to ask for job cards with work order numbers. Among the technicians or contractors most likely to request access to the properties of customers were meter readers, cut-off teams and meter maintenance teams. City Power has urged its customers to report any suspicious individuals or vehicles on 0860562874 or to the risk control unit 0114907911/00      The Star
