The newly appointed Acting CEO of Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital Acting has a cloud hanging over his head over the Life Esidimeni tragedy. This is according to the DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC Jack Bloom who said he was concerned that questions still remain about the role played which the new Acting CEO, Dr Richard Lebethe, played in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. "As Deputy Director General Clinical Services Dr Lebethe was in a position to raise concerns about the botched transfer of Esidimeni psychiatric patients and he was one of the senior officials blamed by former Gauteng Health Qedani Mahlangu. "Earlier this year I asked Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa whether there would be a disciplinary process concerning his role in the Esidimeni disaster and she said that this was being assessed in the light of the testimony at the Arbitration hearings chaired by Justice Dikgang Moseneke. "It's unfortunate that there is a cloud over Lebethe’s head as he takes over the top position at this major hospital," he said. Bloom said the real need at Chris Hani Baragwanath was for a permanent CEO with dynamic leadership skills  but that there had been an inexcusable delay in appointing such a person since Mahlangu removed the previous CEO in January 2016. "Ramokgopa should ensure that corruption allegations at the hospital are speedily investigated and a capable new CEO appointed as soon as possible," he said.
