Brian Hlongwa and Qedani Mahlangu must be sent to jail for their role in the corrupt activities that have almost collapsed the Gauteng Health Department. This is according to the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), which protested against the two former Gauteng health MECs being appointed to the ANC provincial executive committee (PEC). Members of the TAC marched to the Gauteng Provincial Legislature demanding that Mahlangu and Hlongwa be booted out of the PEC. Proceedings inside the Legislature were adjourned when the protesters arrived at the House. DA shadow health MEC Jack Bloom said it had been a long fight trying to hold the two accountable. “It has been more than 10 years asking that Brian Hlongwa be charged for his role in collapsing the health system,” Bloom said. Mahlangu resigned following the death of 144 psychiatric patients in the Life Esidimeni tragedy, while Hlongwa is accused of facilitating corruption amounting to about R1.2billion within the Gauteng Health Department during his tenure. Despite controversy surrounding them, the two were re-elected to the ANC PEC last month. “It is now 47 days since the Special Investigating Unit report was made public that implicates Hlongwa in massive corruption, but he has still not been fired. “How many more days before he is removed from the Gauteng Legislature and faces trial in court?” Bloom asked. TAC national chairperson Sibongile Tshabalala said Premier David Makhura had shown disrespect in not meeting the protestors. “Makhura showed us today that he does not respect us. If the ANC wants us to vote for them next year, they need to do the right thing. They need to listen to taxpayers. “Minister (Aaron) Motsoaledi cannot keep on saying he cannot make any decisions on provincial departments. He needs to take responsibility,” Tshabalala said. The Speaker of the Gauteng Legislature, Ntombi Mekgwe, promised the protesters that the Legislature would start the process of holding the two accountable. The Star
