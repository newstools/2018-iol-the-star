Johannesburg - A 25-year-old man from Alexandra murdered a car guard in the Joburg CBD over stolen items from his car. Captain Xolile Mbele of the Joburg Central police said the suspect assaulted the 26-year-old car guard with fists. The suspect, on Tuesday around 7:30pm, parked his Silver Grey Toyota Yaris  at corner Rissik and Pritchard Street to go buy food at Macdonald’s. When he returned, he realised that two bags were missing from his vehicle and questioned the car guard. It was at this time when the fight ensued, Mbele said. Inside the suspect’s bags were toiletries, his ID book and Matric certificate. The suspect drove off and when paramedics arrived, the car guard was certified dead at the scene. The suspect handed himself over to the police on Friday after they visited his home in Alexandra. An investigation is under way and the suspect is appearing tomorrow in the Joburg Magistrate Court on a charge of murder. Mbele urged the community to refrain from taking the law into their own hands when a crime is committed. “Report the incident to the police,” he said. The Star
