As many South Africans come to the fore to reminisce on their shared moments with the late star, Linda "ProKid" Mkhize, rapper Makizar reflects on the last two weeks he spent with the star recording the song. The two rappers were working on a single together, produced by Bruno, and feels a bitter loss as they hadn’t completed the track. “I was in studio over two weeks ago with Pro and we were actually supposed to record two new tracks. One with only the two of us, and the second with another artist joining in. “The unfortunate thing is that we didn’t finish the songs.” Makizar recalls on how Prokid was not at his optimum, but attributed that to the long day they had with drinks shared in between. “Pro had always been a respectable person, he was always in control of things but when we were in studio, he didn’t exactly seem to be in good health from what I could see. I thought it’s because we were drinking. But he didn’t seem like he was himself. He was zoning out and it didn’t make sense to me. I wasn’t too proud of how he was looking, and it didn’t look like Pro,” he said. Hearing of the passing of the revered rapper was shocking and left Makizar disheartened.  “On Thursday morning Bruno had tagged me in a post saying “RIP Pro,” and it didn’t make sense. It was a major shock to me. “After his passing, I kept looking at that footage and I could see something wasn’t right, he just wasn’t himself at all. I should’ve made more of on effort, to speak to him, to try and find out what was going on. We were not close so I doubt he would have opened up about certain things. ProKid is survived by wife Ayanda, his three-year-old daughter Nonkanyezi, parents and his brothers. His memorial service is scheduled to be held today at Newtown Music Factory (Old Bassline) at 2pm and his funeral will be held at UJ Soweto campus at 8am on Sunday. The star will be laid to rest at Westpark Cemetery. @AmandaMaliba @LesegoMakgatho
