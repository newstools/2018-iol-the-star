Johannesburg - The EFF's deputy president Floyd Shivambu spent some time behind bars in the Free State after being caught speeding in Winburg. Head of Communications for Roads and Transport in the province, Hillary Mophethe, confirmed the arrest and said that Shivambu was travelling from Gauteng to the Free State and was going at 182km/h in a 120km/h zone on Sunday morning. "He was alone in the car. After being caught he was taken to the cells and his car was later impounded. It was later given back to him after he was released on bail," she said. Mophethe confirmed that Shivambu did not resist arrest, cooperated with the police and that he was to appear in court this Friday. This will be the second time this year that Shivambu finds himself in trouble. A few months ago he was caught on camera with his hand around the throat of Netwerk24 photographer Adrian de Kock outside Parliament.        De Kock said he had gone over to Shivambu to try and get comment from him about the Patricia de Lille hearing, just to see if, as the opposition, he had any comment. "I went to him and I said to him: 'Do you have any comment,' and he said: 'No, you must delete the picture,' and I said: 'I can't delete the pictures'. "And then he started grabbing my camera, trying to delete the pictures… He went for my camera and then tried to break my camera," De Kock said at the time. The Star
