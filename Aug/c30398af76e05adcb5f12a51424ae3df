LONDON - Liverpool took the unprecedented step of reporting Mohamed Salah to the police after he was filmed apparently using a mobile phone while driving. Footage posted online appeared to show Salah using his phone at the wheel of his Mercedes, which was surrounded by children, after Sunday’s 4-0 win over West Ham at Anfield. The Egypt striker had scored the opening goal of the game. Salah reported to the club’s Melwood training base on Monday morning, along with the rest of the squad, after he had played 88 minutes against West Ham. But at 1pm on Monday, Merseyside Police said they were aware of the video and Liverpool later confirmed they had alerted the police after discussions with Salah, who earlier this summer became their highest paid player when he signed a new five-year contract. It is illegal to use a handheld mobile phone when driving, even while stopped at traffic lights or queuing in traffic. The video, which was posted on Facebook, shows Salah with his phone in his hand and later, after moving his car further forward, with both hands on the phone as he sits in traffic. A Liverpool spokesman said: "The club, after discussion with the player, made Merseyside Police aware of the footage and the circumstances surrounding its capture. We have spoken to the player also and will deal with any follow-up internally. Neither the club nor player will be making any further comment on this matter." Merseyside Police confirmed: "We have been made aware of a video believed to show a footballer using a mobile phone while driving. This has been passed to the relevant department." Penalties for using a phone while driving can include up to six points on the drivers’ licence and a fine of £200.     Salah nice guy1!1!1!1! pic.twitter.com/apV59CyHbc — JM (@JoseMindset)
