Johannesburg - Women’s Month this year has been jam packed with different events and initiatives to highlight issues of women and their strength and the Johannesburg Metro Police (JMPD), Disaster and Emergency Management Services (EMS) and the Licencing Department were not going to be left behind. On Tuesday, 200 female members of JMPD, EMS and the other department  embarked on an awareness walk to highlight the plight of harassment and equal opportunity in the workplace. The women,uniformed and non-uniformed, started their march at Florida Fire Station in Roodepoort and walked along Ontdekkers Road to the JMPD head office in Martindale where they would hand over a memorandum. JMPD spokesperson Edna Mamonyane said the purpose of the walk was for the women to say they want to be treated as humans beings, not just as women. “We are as equally capable as our male counterparts,” she said. “We need to be recommended for positions at the top management. We want to be respected.” Mamonyane added that they want sexual harassment at the workplace to be a thing of the past. “This walk must also say to the public that 'we want you to know and understand that when you call an ambulance and there are two females from the ambulance that get there and save a life, don’t see it as an opportunity it as an opportunity to rape a woman'. The women’s spirits were high while they walked, holding signs that read:  “Wathinta umfazi, wathint’ imbokodo”, “Real men are feminists”, “We are not ovary-acting” and “Our bodies. Our minds. Our power.” Leading the march were female JMPD officers driving motorbikes and JMPD vehicles. They would occasionally stop their vehicles to rev their engine, causing excitement in the crowds. @Chulu_M
