A couple who yielded at a non-functioning traffic light to give way to other vehicles paid dearly with their lives when bullets rained on their vehicle as it stopped. The incident happened in at the corners of Impala Street and Rose Avenue on Sunday morning around 2.30am. The motive for the drive by shooting is unknown. Captain Mpande Khoza said the traffic lights were not working at the intersection when “a couple driving a bakkie yielded to other vehicles which were already in the crossing.” He said within seconds the couple were suddenly hit by a hail of bullets from an unknown motor vehicle. "We found 17 cartridges at the scene. We don't know if the shooter had been waiting for the couple at that same spot where they were killed.We also don't know how many people were in the other car where the gunshots came from. When we got there the couple were already dead and the shooter was gone," Khoza said. Khoza also confirmed that the man, 48, was originally from Limpopo and had been visiting in Protea Glen when he was shot. It's not yet know how old his girlfriend was, where she lived and where the two came from at the time of the killing. "The suspects are unknown at the present moment; it's also not clear what the motive for the murder was,” he said. A case of murder has been opened at the Lenasia Police Station and the suspects haven’t been arrested yet. @SthembisoMedia
