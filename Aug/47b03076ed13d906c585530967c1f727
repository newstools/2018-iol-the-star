Gautrain workers affiliated with the United National Transport Union (UNTU) and Federation of Union South Africa (FEDUSA) are set to go back to work on Tuesday. This is after wage negotiations and conditions of employment hit a brick wall for two weeks.      Gautrain workers downed tools on July 30 demanding a 10 % basic salary hike, R1 600 per month housing allowance, a R20 000 per annum unconditional bonus per employee, an increase in night work transport subsidy of R64 per night shift and a 55% medical aid contribution from the company. Since the protest, the train only operated for six hours a day.      The workers reached an agreement during  Monday’s meeting at the Bombela depot in Midrand. The new offer states: Basic salary increment of 8%, housing increase of R150, nightshift is nothing less than 8%, medical aid will remain at 50-50 contribution by the employee and worker, incentive of R10 000 where R5 000 is guaranteed by December 31 and the other half depends on the overall company's performance. @Siphumelele_K
