Gauteng EFF members plan to protest outside Adam Catzevelos’ house on Friday morning. This follows a video which he himself recorded on a beach in a foreign country likening where he was to "heaven on earth due" to the fact that there were no black people in sight. He also used the K-word to refer to black people. A member of the party who declined to be named confirmed that members would assemble at Catzevelos place of residence to make a statement to not only him "but all whites at large". Gauteng chairperson of the party, Mandisa Mashego, said she would not be present and people could do what they wanted to voice their rights. “I am having a meeting with the police this morning and they are assisting us. They are pursuing investigations and this is not only EFF’s fight. It is everyone’s fight,” she said. Since the video emerged, Catzavelos' ID number, house, cellphone number, his wife's name and place of employment and their children's school name were splashed on Twitter. Catzavelos has since apologised but many people are not buying that. They said the apology was insincere as one twitter user, @khamas_revenge pointed out: "He apologized to his wife, mom, dad, sister and brother. No mention to the 50 million POC he offended. Read between the lines." Another, @takalanishaku said: "Too late for such mickey mouse :we forgave apartheid instigators, but we didn't forget and you are busy continuing with legacy you earned from your forefathers."
