The SABC has appointed Neo Momodu as Group Executive: Corporate Affairs and Marketing. This is the position that used to be held by Hlaudi Motsoeneng before he was booted out. According to the SABC, Momodu-who previously worked for the SABC in the Public Affairs division- has over 20 years’ experience in marketing, communications and stakeholder engagement. In a statement, the SABC said Momodu will work with the executive management team in the positioning of the SABC as an authentic and world-class public service broadcaster to fulfil its mandate of acting continuously for the betterment of the South African society. She will also be responsible for enhancing the SABC’s engagement strategies with its key stakeholders, acting as the overall driver of corporate communications and marketing, it said. “I am thrilled to welcome Ms. Momodu to the SABC. She joins at a critical stage where we are working towards turning around the organisation. Ms. Momodu brings an impressive career in the media and communications sphere as well as valuable experience with our brands. We are confident that she is equipped to lead this critical division of the organisation. The Board and management of the SABC, wish Ms. Momodu well in executing her duties," said SABC Group Chief Executive Officer, Madoda Mxakwe. As part of her responsibilities, Momodu will also take up the role of SABC spokesperson. The SABC fired Motsoeneng in June 2017 following a finding by a disciplinary committee that he was guilty of bringing the broadcaster into disrepute at a controversial media conference that he called on April 17 2017. In the briefing‚ which lasted four hours‚ Motsoeneng defended his 90% local music content quota‚ criticised a parliamentary ad hoc committee probe into the fitness of the SABC and insulted interim SABC board member Krish Naidoo.
