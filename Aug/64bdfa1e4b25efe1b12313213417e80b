Undeveloped land must be expropriated to accommodate the growing population in adequate human settlements. This is according to Executive Mayor of Ekurhuleni Mzwandile Masina who was speaking at the Metropolis Annual Meeting that is currently underway at the Sandton Convention Centre on Wednesday. Speaking as one of the panelists under the topic of Inclusive Settlement Development, Masina  indicated that while the City was rolling out serviced stands and rental stock projects as part of the City’s strategies to provide adequate human settlements, the expropriation of undeveloped land was also an option.  “We will tap into exploring options of expropriating land that has remained unused and undeveloped since 1994 in the interest of promoting inclusive human settlement,” Masina said.  Among the projects that are currently underway that the Masina alluded to was the allocation of serviced stands so that communities living in congested informal settlements are settled in areas where their dignity is restored by having basic services, such as electricity, roads and water.  He also said the City has a target of providing 6 000 rental stock units during the current term of office.  "This type are already finished and occupied at the Germiston city centre. This is to cater for residents who are not ready to buy a house, and those who previously had little means to live in the CBD, closer to work.  "The 6 000 rental stock target for the five-year term will double the number of rental stock units that the City already has," he said.  The Metropolis Annual Meeting,which ends on Wednesday, is hosting mayors of big international cities and local cities, leaders of national and regional governments as well as global development partners.  The Metropolis Annual Meeting was held with recognition that local governments are major actors in the global response to the urban challenges of the century.
