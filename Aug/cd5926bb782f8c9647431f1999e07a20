Police have arrested a 34-year-old man, the sixth and last suspect wanted in connection with last year’s murder of actor Dumisani Masilela. The suspect appeared in the Benoni Magistrate’s Court yesterday, after which he joined his alleged accomplices set for trial in the North Gauteng High Court from October 8 to 19, Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said. “A year ago, Masilela was fatally shot during a hijacking in Tembisa. Police were able to establish that a total of six suspects were behind the murder. “The initial four were arrested last year, while the fifth suspect died in a robbery. “All the suspects had been positively linked to five cases” the murder of Masilela; three car hijackings, reported in Daveyton, Phokeng and Siyabuswa, and a case in Boitekong of possession of a stolen cellphone.” Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange praised the intelligence-led multi-disciplinary police team, saying: “This successful arrest brought about by such meticulous investigation will go a long way in ensuring that serious and violent crimes plaguing Gauteng are reduced to their lowest level.” - African News Agency (ANA)
