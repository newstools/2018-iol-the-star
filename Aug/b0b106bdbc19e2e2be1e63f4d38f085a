Fears of emotional trauma for the alleged victims of confessed paedophile Collin Rex have necessitated the use of an intermediary to assist the witnesses as the trial continues. On Tuesday morning, prosecutor Advocate Arveena Persad said the State would use the services of a qualified social worker with seven years experience to help a teenage witness who was allegedly abused by Rex; a former assistant water polo coach at Parktown Boys High School in Joburg. Rex, who is appearing in the South Gauteng High Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court in Ekurhuleni, has already pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the now 17-year-old boy. He also pleaded guilty to molesting 11 other schoolboys in a reign of terror which lasted from 2015 to 2016. The abuse happened on the school premises. In addition to 144 acts of sexual assault he pleaded guilty to, the 22-year-old Rex is facing a further 183 charges ranging from attempted murder, rape, sexual grooming and exposing minors to pornography. Tintswalo Matumbi, the qualified social worker, told the court that she possessed a BA in Psychology and an Honors degree in social work. Judge Peet Johnson accepted her credentials and allowed her to mediate. Rex’s  acts came to light after sports apparel and other school supplies went missing. This led to the viewing of CCTV footage, which exposed Rex and blew the lid on his predatory two-year reign. The trial continues.  @khayakoko88
