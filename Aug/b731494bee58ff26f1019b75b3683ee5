Joburg residents have, for far too long, been ignoring City of Joburg building by-laws and doing what they please. So said the city’s member of the mayoral committee Reuben Masanga while witnessing the demolition of three wooden structures illegally built on a Northcliff property on Friday. Neighbours have been complaining for years about these illegal huts which were being rented out and being used as storage. The owner, a company called Serviplex, was issued with a demolition order in 2016. “We went through all the court processes which were completely ignored. The lawlessness and non-compliance of by laws will no longer be tolerated. We intend acting on all the demolition orders we have. People have become complacent and believe the city will never go through with demolishing,” said the MMC, adding that actual demolitions took a long time because legal procedures and processes have to be abided by. The owners were informed of the imminent demolition this week by city officials who were told ‘to go ahead’. “We are now starting the by-law enforcement in earnest. We cannot continue allowing this lawlessness, “ he added. Tenant Liam da Roche attempted to stop the demolition, saying he would be homeless. He said he was paying rent to one of the owners who was cycling in Italy in a professional capacity. “I have nowhere to go now - these people are heartless,” he said. The city, however, said that was not an eviction order as the area was zoned for business.
