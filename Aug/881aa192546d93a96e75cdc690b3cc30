An "intelligence-driven" operation within the Gauteng SAPS has nabbed three police officers from Soweto for allegedly hijacking a truck in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni. The crime is alleged to have been committed in February. Gauteng SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters confirmed on Wednesday that the police's provincial organised crime unit arrested the three K9 unit officers on Monday following what she referred to as an "intelligence-driven" operation, which began after the hijacking. "Information obtained from that operation led investigators to make the arrests on Monday. The suspects appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court on Tuesday," Peters said. She refused to be drawn into revealing whether the three officers had prior criminal records or whether they were linked to other violent crimes during their services in the police. "I also don't want to comment further about the investigation as the case is before the courts now," Peters added. This follows Police Minister Bheki Cele confirming in March that 57 SAPS officers have criminal records or cases pending against them.  Cele was responding to an oral question in Parliament posed by DA MP Zakhele Mbele, where the minister added that  were found to be working in a department that deals with vulnerable victims of assault and sexual abuse and what corrective measures were being taken. “They should not be there to deal especially with children and they should not be there to deal with abused … and mostly female [victims] who have been assaulted, who have been violated, some of them by their own partners," Cele said.  @khayakoko88
