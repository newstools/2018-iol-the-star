Johannesburg - Mpumalanga police made a startling discovery of heroin estimated at R3.3-million hidden in the bonnet of a car when they stopped and searched a vehicle coming from Mozambique. The drugs were wrapped in yellow plastic bags and stuffed in the bonnet of the old black sedan. Mpumalanga police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said the discovery was made on Monday morning around 9am and that the man who was driving the car managed to get away and is still at large. Picture: Supplied He said the suspicion was that the man was a Mozambique national. “The vehicle number plates were Mozambique registered. It was coming from Mozambique coming to the country [South Africa]. As the vehicle entered the border, there was an operation. Officers stopped the vehicle and asked to search it. “The officials wanted to search the engine compartment; the driver said the bonnet is difficult to open and pretended to be looking for a tool to open it and in the process he disappeared. The team managed to open the bonnet and the staggering discovery was made,” Bhembe.  Picture: Supplied Bhembe said they were still looking for the suspect who is still on the run. He said once they find him, he will be charged with being in possession of drugs. He also said they normally encounter these kinds of cases. The public is urged to assist police in their investigation if they have any relevant information by calling Sergeant Danny Sanderson from the Hawks on 082 462 1817 or the SAPS Crime Stop number, 08600 10111.  @SthembisoMedia  The Star
