A nine-year-old boy was left critically injured on Thursday night when he was dragged behind a bakkie for approximately 2,5km in Roodepoort.   This was after he and his friends had jumped onto the back of the bakkie at an intersection. After the bakkie drove some distance, the boy attempted to jump off the vehicle but his foot got caught in the cargo netting.   ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said the driver was allegedly alerted to the boy being dragged behind his vehicle by another motorist.   “He and a bunch of friends allegedly jumped into the back of a bikkie. The driver apparently did not know that the kids were there. After travelling some distance, they tried to jump off. His foot got caught in cargo netting at the back of the bakkie.   “A passing motorist alerted the driver that there was a child at the back. He pulled over at a filling station at the Main Reef and Roode Road Intersection,” he said.   Meiring said ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene at 19.20. He said “upon assessment, paramedics found that the boy had sustained serious injuries to his back and buttocks, leaving him seriously injured.”   Meiring said practices such as those could leave one with serious injuries and also lead to death.   The boy was treated for his injuries and provided with pain-relief before being  transported to Leratong Provincial Hospital.
