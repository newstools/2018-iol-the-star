The Acer Spin 5 Notebook is the perfect example of a notebook that transforms one’s writing and viewing experience. It’s slim and compatible for travel, school, work or entertainment - it’s the perfect option. I spend a lot of time on my laptop, whether at work or at home, as it has become my number one option for viewing series, movies, getting news and typing stories. With my old laptop on its last lifeline, after my niece threw a ruler at my screen, I have been in search of a new one. So, when I was handed the Acer, I fell in love with it instantly. The first feature that caught my interest was the touch screen. The notebook comes with an Acer Active Stylus, which is a touch screen pen and allows for a better interaction with the screen. You still need the mouse for basic features, but the advantage of on-screen interaction makes for a great experience.

Another surprise was the fingerprint reader and the voice recognition features. I liked the voice activation, as it adds a much-loved feature that I also use on my phone. The fingerprint reader provides for tighter security protection. The sound system was incredible, especially for those who like binging on Netflix. It also allows for the full HD experience. Lastly, if you would rather avoid carrying a charger, the up to 13-hour battery life will allow you to do as much as you can without the need to charge. So, if you have been searching for a new notebook, the Acer Spin is here to transform your life.
