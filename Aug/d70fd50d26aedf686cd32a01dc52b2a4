Health workers at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital are jubilant after the hospital’s acting CEO stepped down. In a meeting held on Monday night, it was agreed that the acting chief executive officer Dr Sifiso Maseko has been removed from his post at the Soweto hospital. Investigations of corruption and exploitation will be handed over to a private investigator and over-time payments will be sorted by the newly elected head of the institute. The meeting was between union leaders, hospital representatives and the head of Gauteng health department Dr Mkhululi Lukhele. Speaking to The Star on Tuesday morning, Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa’s (Denosa) spokesperson Yandisa Zungula said the workers were very pleased with the outcome of the meeting. Zungulu said they hope that they will have a good relationship with the new CEO. Workers were promised that a new CEO will be appointed within 24 hours. On Monday health workers were protesting about the alleged corrupt hospital’s acting CEO and his delegates. This was based on investigations on claims of corruption and exploitation of women and the overtime payments for workers by the former CEO.   Denosa has been looking into private companies to find a private investigator to look into allegations brought against Maseko and his delegates. Workers resumed their duties on Tuesday morning and Zungula confirmed that “the atmosphere at the hospital is calm”. The Star
