JOHANNESBURG-  A lot is known about blood, liver and heart donations. However, only a few people are aware of the dire shortage of skin donations. Cleo Ndhlovu, manager of the Tshwane University of Technology's Centre for Tissue Engineering, said in order to assist patients, mostly burn victims, they need more people to donate their skin tissues. Ndhlovu said while there was a higher need for skin donations in winter because of fires, the centre was also in need throughout the year. As it was, she said, they were unable to meet patients demands. The centre was opened in 2016, Ndhlovu said. “In 2016,  we delivered 65 packs; in 2017 we delivered 108 packs and this year by the end of June we delivered only 60,” Ndhlovu said, adding that the 108 packs delivered last year was only 59 percent of the orders they received. According to the centre, more than 1.6million South Africans suffer from burn wounds every year, 268 severe cases are reported every month. Ndhlovu said some cases of death might be prevented if people receive access to cadaver skin donations that are used in skin grafts. “The skin ensures that the burn wounds heal quickly. This also means that the skin does not get infections,”she said. Ndhlovu said one of the hardest things with skin donations was that even if the donor has agreed to the procedure,  their family still had to sign consent forms once they die. “That is the law but the thing is that we are racing against time. We only have 24-hours to remove the skin once the person dies. If families still want to go home and make decisions, we sometimes run out of time,” she said. The centre never takes the skin from the face but from large surface areas from the neck down.  She said one pack was 600 square centimetres - enough to cover one adult.
