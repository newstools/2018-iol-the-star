The Gauteng MEC for Education, Mr Panyaza Lesufi will tomorrow, 17 August 2018, address learners at Unity Secondary School following yesterday’s incident where  the community went on a rampage and set alight an alleged gang member in the area next to the school. It is alleged that members of the community disrupted schooling when they dragged the suspected gang member to the school to point out a learner who is alleged to be part of the gang. After failing to find the said learner, the gang member tried to escape but was accosted by the community in full view of learners, said Steve Mabona, Gauteng Department of Education’s Spokesperson. The said gang is suspected of committing crimes such as robberies and murders in Daveyton. The alleged gang member is currently recovering in hospital after sustaining burn wounds, he said. Police are investigating the matter. “We strongly condemn the disruption of schooling and urge the community to remain calm and allow the law to take its cause. Schools are centres of teaching and learning, they should be treated as such,” said MEC Lesufi. Lesufi’s address will take place at Unity Secondary School at 10am.
