JOHANNEBSURG- Dr Anele Mngadi has congratulated businesswoman Dr Judy Dlamini on being elected chancellor of Wits University following a strong contest between the two black academics for the top job. Dlamini is the first black female chancellor to be appointed by the university and will take up the position from December 1. She takes the reins from retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke, who has served for two six-year terms in the position. “I wish to congratulate Dr Judy Dlamini on being elected chancellor of Wits and wish her the best in shaping the university to achieve its full potential as a knowledge- and innovation-based institution,” said Dr Anele Mngadi, who went head to head with Dlamini for the position. “I am confident that under Dr Dlamini’s leadership Wits will build on its strengths and excel in every aspect of this mission," she said. Dlamini is a medical doctor by training, a leading businesswoman, entrepreneur, author, and philanthropist while Mngadi is a university professor, non-executive chairperson and a community builder. “It is an honour and a pleasure to be elected as the chancellor of the University of the Witwatersrand, one of the most prestigious universities on the continent. I would like to thank Convocation for its confidence in me. I look forward to working with all sectors of the Wits community," Dlamini said. - African News Agency (ANA)
