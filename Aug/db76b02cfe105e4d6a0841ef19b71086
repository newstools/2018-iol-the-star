Former first lady Zanele Mbeki will be awarded the 2018 Top Women Lifetime Achiever Award under the Standard Bank top 10 women initiative.  Standard Bank “top women” celebrates her 15 year anniversary this year. They have partnered with an organisation called the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE). The CGE was created by the Constitution to strengthen constitutional democracy through gender equality. The CGE said they promote respect for and the protection, development, and attainment of gender equality. They also act as a catalyst for this transformation and a champion for the Bill of Rights. With Women's Month encouraging gender empowerment, South Africa is reminded of the challenges that threaten the transformation of gender relations on a day-to-day basis. As a nation, society is warned about the collective responsibility to combat the oppression and inequality of women each day of the year, and not just in Women's Month. The initiative has become an impactful movement across the country presenting a year-round drive of citizen action to assemble decision makers in public and private sectors with communities to boost gender empowerment."It is our honour to stand side-by-side with the CGE as allies, and we are proud to join their distinguished community of South African and international social justice institutions in the pursuit of the vision for a society free from gender oppression and inequality. We are devoted to providing the ultimate platform to address the challenges facing women-driven economic growth,” said the director of Standard Bank Karla Fletcher.She also said that she was excited about the work and calibre of this year's finalists. “Join us in celebrating their achievements in realising gender equality, and appreciating our shared goals to reaching,” she added.
