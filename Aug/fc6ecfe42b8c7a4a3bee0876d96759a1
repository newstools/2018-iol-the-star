At least three police officers sustained leg injuries while two were taken to hospital after being attacked by protesters This happened on Tuesday and allegation are that SAPS Public Order Police (POP) members were attending to a complaint at a Biscuit Company in Kimberly Avenue in Nancefield when approximately about 200 people barracked the entrance to the company, preventing the staff and security from leaving the premises. It's not clear why protesters baracaded the entrance. According to police, protesters refused to listen to the calls from the police to disperse which lead to the POP members dispersing them using “minimum” force. Spokesperson for the National Commissioner - Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said the protesters regrouped along Stockwell Street and started stoning passing vehicles. “The POP members responded again but this time they were pelted with stones and a petrol bomb was thrown at a Nyala vehicle, setting it ablaze. At least three POP members sustained leg injuries from the stones-throwing. Two members were taken to a local hospital for treatment,” he said. National Commissioner of the South African Police Service, General Khehla John Sitole condemned the attack, saying the behaviour of the protesters "has done nothing more than to undermine the authority of the State". "The visuals of the burning police Nyala does not auger well for the development of the Grand Economic Strategy of our country,”  Sitole said. Police have urged any information may call the SAPS Crime Stop number 086 00 10111.
