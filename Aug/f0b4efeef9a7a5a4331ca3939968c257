Glue used to repair shoes is suspected to have triggered the fire that destroyed an illegal warehouse in the Joburg CBD. The owner of the warehouse is believed to have fled the scene shortly after his building went up in flames yesterday morning. Commissioner Street had to be blocked off, said Johannesburg Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi. No injuries were reported, but residents in a block of flats adjacent to the warehouse were evacuated from the building to avoid possible smoke inhalation. The cause of the fire is unknown but it is said that glue used to fix shoes was found in the building. “As early as 1am the fire broke out and emergency services were called to the scene to assist. "As you can see, there is excessive storage of glue and other highly flammable stuff inside the warehouse,” Mulaudzi said. “We want to urge all our business people who are operating within the CBD to comply with the city by-laws. “Adjacent to the building is a residential area which is not complying with the city's regulations,” he said. When The Star arrived at the scene, the wife of the warehouse owner said her husband had fled after he was unable to stop the fire. @Zwane_2li2ls The Star
