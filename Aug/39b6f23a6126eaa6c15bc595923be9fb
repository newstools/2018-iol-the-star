Johannesburg - The popular Skeem Saam actress who accused her former husband of abuse received support from castmates and community members when she appeared in court. Shoki Mmola-Sebotsane - who plays the role of MaKunutu on Skeem Saam - and her former husband, Broken Vows actor Sello Sebotsane appeared at the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday morning. Sebotsane is facing charges of domestic violence and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mmola-Sebotsane arrived wearing a pale blue blazer, white jersey, white pants and a cream scarf. When she entered the full courtroom, she smiled and briefly spoke to Skeem Saam's Clement Maosa - famously known as Kwaito in the soapie-and his friend. Sebotsane, on the other hand, sat in the first row of the court quietly with two relatives, one elderly woman and a middle-aged man. The former couple sat less than 3 metres apart with a pillar dividing them and at no point did they interact with each other. The actress was married to Sebotsane for 10 years and in March last year she revealed how abusive her marriage was. She said she would sleep with a knife underneath her pillow in case she would have to defend herself in the middle of the night. Members of the Thembisile Lucia Yende foundation also showed their support for Mmola-Sebotsane by wearing #JusticeforShoki T-shirts in court. ANC members were also present. @Chulu_M The Star
