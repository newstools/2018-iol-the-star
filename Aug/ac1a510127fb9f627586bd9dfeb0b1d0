Police have managed to arrest two suspects for the gruesome alleged mob justice killing of a teenager following riots over suspected crimes around schools in Daveyton this week.                                                       A high-level task team established by Gauteng’s police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange nabbed the two suspects in Ekurhuleni on Thursday in an effort to quell the violent tensions. De Lange established the team on her visit to Daveyton on Thursday. This subsequently led to the arrest of two suspects in connection with the murder of a 19-year-old victim. The victim was assaulted, stabbed and shot to death outside his house on the Wednesday allegedly by a group of community members. One murder weapon linked to the death of the victim has been recovered and the police are still looking for another, a firearm used at the scene. Police still expect to make more arrests for this murder and an attempted murder of another 19-year-old suspected criminal, who was almost burnt alive outside a Daveyton primary school. This victim is currently in a stable condition in hospital. A group of community members allegedly accused five men from the area, including the deceased for supposedly terrorizing them. However, the police confirmed that there were no complaints, cases opened or arrests for the allegations of the teenagers causing havoc in the township. Police have also clarified that images circulating on social media of a person being burnt with a tyre around their body are not in any way linked to the incident which happened in Daveyton. “People should refrain from stirring up the tensions through irresponsible and malicious circulation of false information. And in the same manner people should report crime to police and not take the law into their hands” said De Lange.
