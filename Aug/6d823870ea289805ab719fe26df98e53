The long arm of the law seems to have caught up with Duduzane Zuma yet again. The son of former president Jacob Zuma will be appearing at the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday to answer for the deaths of two people who died in an accident he was involved in four years ago. This follows another court appearance he did in last month at the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court which set tongues wagging due to the fact that he was shackled. At the time, Zuma was in court for corruption charges, alternatively conspiracy to commit corruption, relating to an alleged R600m offer made to former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas in 2015 by Ajay Gupta in his presence. He was later released on a R100 000 bail. On Thursday, Zuma will be in court to face two counts of culpable homicide over the deaths of Nankie Mashaba and  Zimbabwean national Phumzile Dube. On a rainy night of February 1 2014, Zuma was driving on the M1 when his Porsche rear-ended Jabulani Vusi Dlamini's minibus taxi around 10pm. Dube was killed and three others  injured. Mashaba later died in hospital. Zuma had said he had lost control of his Porsche after it hit a puddle. It spun and hit the back of the taxi, coming to a standstill facing oncoming traffic, he said. An inquest was later held where it was ruled that Dube's death was caused by negligence on Zuma's part. However, the National Prosecuting Authority declined to prosecute, citing insufficient evidence. This then led to AfriForum vowing to seek justice through a private prosecution. Afriforum’s advocate Gerrie Nel applied for a certificate of non prosecution from the NPA in October last year, to enable him to privately prosecute Zuma on behalf of the Dube family. However, the NPA  made a u-turn early this year and announced that it would prosecute.
