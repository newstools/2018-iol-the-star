JOHANNESBURG-  Land invasion seems to be the main reason for a protest that erupted in Lawley south of Johannesburg on Wednesday morning. Protesters barricaded roads and burnt tyres, calling on government and police to stop land invasion in Ennerdale. The protesters said the land that shack dwellers have invaded belonged to them as the government promised to develop it. Scores of shacks have been built on the land and the shack dwellers are standing their ground and refuse to leave. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson, Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the land was being disputed and a court case was underway. “There is a group of people living in that area who are saying they are not satisfied with the process and the progress. They want all those shacks removed sooner because that land belongs to people who had bought houses. The court case is pending,” he said. Police were monitoring the situation and there had been no arrests yet. @SthembisoMedia
