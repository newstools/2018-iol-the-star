It does not rain but pour for the former Parktown Boys' High School waterpolo coach accused of molesting school boys after he was slapped with more charges. Seven more schoolboys who allegedly suffered gruesome sexual assault at the hands of the 22 former waterpolo coach at the prestigious school have come forward This emerged on Tuesday at the Palmridge Magistrate's Court in Ekurhuleni, where the accused- who cannot be named until he has pleaded- is alleged to have been embroiled in a roughly two-year stint of molestation, rape and showing pornographic material to the Joburg school's teenage learners. Many of the supposed crimes were allegedly committed on the school's premises. This has increased the number of complaints from 16 to 23 and the number of charges from 160 to 327. The alleged 22-year-old child molester is facing over 90 counts of sexual assault, one of rape for allegedly inserting his fingers in a schoolboy's anus and dozens more charges of attempted murder. The attempted murder charges relate to allegedly choking which the former coach allegedly did to the learners during his supposed reign of terror. The judge agreed to postpone the case to August 21 as and the prosecutor, Advocate Arveena Persad said she and the the accused's defence team were still deliberating on a way forward. The accused looked calm and unperturbed during his court appearance, sporting a sharp grey-blue suit and light blue tie.  He is out on bail.  @khayakoko88
