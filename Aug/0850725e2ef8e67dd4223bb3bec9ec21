The main Womandla stage will feature a line-up of performances from women who have been part of shaping the South Africa's musical landscape. They will then pay tribute to the late Struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Lira spoke to The Star (TS) about her thoughts on women and Mama Winnie:  TS: What did Mama Winnie mean to you? LIRA: She was the epitome of strength, courage, resilience and determination for me. Not many of us could handle what she went through and come out standing. I felt a deep sense of responsibility to do the utmost best with the life I have been afforded. Because if Mama Winnie could accomplish this under the circumstances that she faced, surely I could strive to do the same under much lighter circumstances.  TS: What makes you most proud to be a woman? LIRA: As I get older I'm most proud of embrac- ing all the things that make me a woman - my intuition, my strength, my emotions, my power, my resilience and my grace. I love being influential to girls and other women because we are beacons of life for each other. I love breaking old ideas of what women should be.  TS: How are you living up to the values that Mama Winnie stood for? LIRA: Mama Winnie's passing gave us all a chance to relive her life and her journey, and it left me feeling charged with determination to be even more resilient, courageous, confident and strong, and to stubbornly go after my dreams.  TS: What can fans expect from the Womandla stage? LIRA: I'm looking forward to giving our guests great entertainment and great music - including the Born Free tribute song that I made for Mama Winnie.  Other stars set to headline the two-day festival are Erykah Badu and New Zealand’s rising icon multi-instrumentalist Jordan Rakei, Jazzanova Live and D’Influence. There will also be a dance arena featuring Todd Terry, DJ Christos, Vinny Da Vinci, DJ Oskido, DJ Fresh and Greg Maloka. The festival takes place on September 22 and 23. @mane_mpi
