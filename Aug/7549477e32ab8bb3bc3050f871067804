Johannesburg - The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) announced on Sunday that it would investigate the allegations made against the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI). On Sunday, Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said: “I confirmed with the relevant people. We are to investigate.” Earlier, Dlamini said the Office of the DPCI, headed by retired judge Frans Kgomo, was the most relevant body to probe complaints against members of the Hawks. “If a matter is referred to us, we will consider it. At this stage, we really don’t have facts,” he said. Dlamini made the comments after the portfolio committee on police at the weekend called for an urgent investigation of serious allegations against DPCI members. Former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas on Friday told Justice Raymond Zondo’s Commission of Inquiry into State Capture how the Hawks attempted to quash a case against the Guptas after it was reported that they tried to bribe him to take a ministerial post. Jonas said Major-General Zinhle Mnonopi told him that they wanted to kill the case, and that she gave him a prepared statement to sign. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman said he noted with serious concern the allegations made about the Hawks at the commission of inquiry. Beukman also said it was imperative that members of the DPCI, especially high-ranking members, act without fear or favour to uphold the law, and that any dereliction of that duty should be properly investigated. He said while the committee acknowledged the proceedings were still under way, any serious allegations against DPCI members should be urgently investigated. “The DPCI should lead in the fight against corruption and any allegations that compromise their role should be subjected to independent investigation.” On Friday, Hawks head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya said he noted with concern the allegations made by Jonas. The Office of the DPCI could not be reached for comment on Sunday. Political Bureau
