The case of the Parktown Boys' former water polo coach who confessed to molesting learners at the prestigious school was postponed to Tuesday as his lawyer is on sick leave. Collin Rex was present in court on Monday, clad in a dark suit and blue tie, as his case was postponed at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court in Ekurhuleni. Prosecutor Advocate Arveena Persad said she had received information on Sunday that Rex's lawyer would be unavailable for the day. The State was expected to lead its first witnessÂ  in the 183 charges that Rex faces ranging from attempted murder, rape, sexual grooming and exposing minors to pornography Last week Rex pleaded guilty last week to 144 counts of sexual assault which he admitted to having committed from 2015 to 2016 on schoolboys aged between 13 and 16 on the school's premises. Some of the sordid acts Rex admitted to including grabbing and squeezing boys' penises, pinching their pubic hairs and rubbing his penis against those of several learners in a lewd act known as dry humping. There were 11 complainants in the 144 counts, and there is a further 12 alleged victims in the 183 charges; bringing the total to 23 schoolboys and 327 charges. The trial continues on Tuesday.
