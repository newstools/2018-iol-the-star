We just want to talk, come out Adam - it's sunny. These were the words that Ekurhuleni EFF members shouted when they reached Adam Catzevols' Edenvale home on Friday. They said they had "visited" Catzavelos residence to send a message to him after his video where he was seen using the K-word to refer to black people. It is believed that he took the video at a beach in Greece. In the video, he was bragging, saying that he was having the time of his life because there was not "a single "k****" in sight". According to Fani Sibeko, the party received a tip-off from security guards in the area that Catzevols was in the house and had been spotted in the morning. Despite the shouting and picketing at the gate, no one came out of the house nor was there a sound or movement. There was just a white BMW parked in the yard. The EFF said they just wanted to welcome Catzevols home as there had been no " k*****" where he was on vacation. Edenvale police were also at the scene, monitoring the situation and by lunchtime, their presence started increasing. According to the police, the party had illegally gathered and instructed the members to disperse. Sipho Watkins, EFF Ekhurhuleni secretary said he was confident that they had sent out a message to Catzavelos. "We came and did what we needed to do. The message has been sent and he knows not to mess with black people," said Watkins.
