Orlando Pirates striker Thamsanqa Gabuza has apologised for leaving the field of play after celebrating his side's opening goal against Black Leopards. The Buccaneers took the lead when Gabuza's cross deflected home by Ndou for the own goal of Bucs’ 2-1 Absa Premiership victory against Leopards. Gabuza celebrated by taking off his jersey and throwing it to the crowd, which angered coach Milutin Sredojević. The striker also made rude hand gestures towards the crowd before he walked off the field. His team was forced to play what was left of the first half with ten men as he did not return to the pitch. The 31-year-old eventually returned to the bench early in the second half, but he was immediately red-carded. His first yellow card was for taking his shirt off during the celebration, and the second for leaving the field without permission. Pirates posted a video of Gabuza apologising on their Twitter account on Wednesday evening.      The Star
