Suspended ANC Joburg regional secretary Thabang Setona who kicked a woman during an anti-Zuma protest outside Luthuli House made a brief appearance in court on Wednesday morning. Setona brutally kicked Nkateko Makete, 52, when violence broke out between  "protect Luthuli House supporters" and Black First Land First (BLF) members during a protest outside Luthuli House in February. He was later charged with assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm. The case was postponed to October to allow Setona’s defense attorney, Nosizo Nkala, time to view the footage taken on the day. Nkala confirmed to the court that she was in possession of all statements from the five state witnesses. A handful members of the BLF yesterday arrived in court to support Makete. In a statement, the party said: “Black First Land First (BLF) continues to stand with Mme Olivia Makete, our comrade, our leader and a dedicated activist of radical transformation. Mme Olivia Makete was violently attacked by Cyril Ramaphosa’s ANC supporters outside Luthuli House on the 5th of February, 2018.” Following widespread reports and calls for Setona to be suspended, the branch released a statement in which Setona apologised for his “heinous, barbaric and dehumanising actions”. “I apologise unequivocally for my heinous acts against an innocent woman. I extend my apology not only to the victim I caused grievous harm to, but to her family, the ANC and South Africa at large. “My behaviour cannot and should not be justified. No amount of anger should lead one to acting in the manner that I did. I take full responsibility for my actions...” said Setona who had held the secretarial position for three years. @smashaba
