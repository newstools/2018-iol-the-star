Prokid is widely acknowledged by artists and music lovers as one of the most influential artists who shaped hip hop in South Africa. During a visit to the family by Minister Nathi Mthethwa and MEC Faith Mazibuko, the family were not only surprised by the overwhelming influence Pro had, but also mentioned their concerns regarding necessary logistical arrangements for his burial, Tumelo Taunyane of the Department of Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation (SACR) said. “In collaboration with the national Department of Arts and Culture, SACR has committed to assisting the family with some of the logistical requirements.” Taunyane said SACR has also managed to facilitate securing the venue for Pro’s funeral, which will be at the University of Johannesburg, Soweto Campus on Sunday. “It is important to note that the funeral is organized and arranged by the family and they have determined the areas where they need assistance.” A memorial service for the revered rapper and Number 1 Soweto Boy is taking place at the Newtown Music Factory in Johannesburg today.
