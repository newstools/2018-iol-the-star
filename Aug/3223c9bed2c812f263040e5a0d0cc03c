Hundreds of angry protesters allegedly destroyed infrastructure in South Hills, Joburg south, over the claims of unfair distribution of houses on Friday. Community members claim that unrecognised and undeserving beneficiaries have been given homes, something that led to a heated tensions between them and their councilor. “The community is complaining that they are not benefiting from their own projects, projects done within their suburbs,” said police spokesperson Captain Jeff Phora. Barbed wire and a heavy police presence in the area could not not stop the rising protests. Resident, Mzwandile Ndlovu, said protests have become more violent because the ward councilor Faeeza Chame snubbed the residents meeting held on Thursday evening. The residents held a meeting to try and figure out what to do next, claiming that it was clear that the new development was not in their favor. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department and the South African Police Services were out in full force guarding the site with help of the Red Ants and fire fighters. Phora confirmed that protesters hurled rocks and also burnt bus stops. Twenty-five people have since been arrested for public violence. Ndlovu, who rents a flat in the area said they were ready  "to build bombs" if that is what it takes for them to be favoured by housing officials. On Wednesday Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba was handing over keys to beneficiaries when people started protesting, saying he was giving preference to people not living in the area. However, the handover still went ahead despite the disturbance.
