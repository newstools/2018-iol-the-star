A grieving daughter was awarded R162 000 (£9,000)  after a funeral home wrongly scattered her mother's ashes after confusing them with someone else's. Elaine Kendall wanted to scatter her mother Hilda's ashes in the sea at Whitby, North Yorkshire, England on what would have been her 91st birthday, on August 12, 2016. However, staff at Co-op Funeralcare, Britain's largest funeral firm, had already dispersed Hilda's ashes in November 2015 believing they belonged to another family who shared the same surname. Kendall, 60, spoke of her upset and pain in a London court as she was awarded the R162 000 for breach of contract, aggravated damages, interest and costs. Her mother had served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service in the Second World War and she was aged 89 when she died on May 3, 2015. Elaine Kendall sat in court with her sister Linda Bullock, 67, as Judge John Hugman said: The breach of contract was more fundamental than they have acknowledged.' The funeral home had initially offered them sisters "a few hundred pounds' as a refund", Kendall said. In a statement Kendall said the funeral home "has poured scorn on my mum's wishes and prolonged the distress and grief that my siblings and I have suffered since that terrible day when we realised we could not carry out mum's wishes." © Daily Mail
