Johannesburg - The City of Johannesburg's Emergency Management Services (EMS) has confirmed that the body of a toddler drowned and swept away along the Klip Valley river in Soweto was recovered. The two-year-old drowned while playing with three other friends next to the river on August 3. It took 11 days for the EMS and the South African Police Service's (SAPS) water wing rescue team to recover the body as the toddler was said to have been trapped in the reef of the river bank. EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi told The Star that the child was found on Tuesday afternoon and it took a while because his body was wasting away and hard to spot in the water. “It was a joint operation between us and the SAPS water wing who assisted in trying to recover the body of the toddler. The family has been with us from day one to identify the body of the child,” said Mulaudzi. Roughly 20 rescue team members were involved in trying to recover the toddler's body since she went missing. SAPS Kliptown spokesperson Captain Hitler Ngwenya confirmed that a docket of inquest had been opened for further investigation. The Star
