Johannesburg - Three shops were gutted when a fire broke out at the East Rand Retail Complex on Thursday morning. The complex is aÂ superior decor, fashion, medical, health and convenience retail centre in Boksburg. The cause of the fire is not known but four shops were saved from totally being destroyed.      Spokesman for the Ekurhuleni Emergency Services, Willie Ntladi said they received a call around 8.30am and they arrived there within a minute as the complex is just behind the fire station. "When we arrived there, one shop was already on fire and it is believed that it is where the fire stated. It is a craft shop and from there the fire spread. Three shops were burnt down completely but we managed to save four shops. There were no injured and no fatalities. We are still on the scene cooling off all the hotspots and it will take a long time," he said. The Star
