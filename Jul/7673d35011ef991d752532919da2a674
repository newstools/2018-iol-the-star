Harare - Nelson Chamisa woke up early to join thousands that got the Zimbabwe election going in the capital Harare on Monday morning. The MDC Alliance leader was mobbed by supporters shortly after casting his vote in the Harare township of Kuwadzana. "We are certain of victory if the vote is not manipulated and it is a great feeling to vote," said Chamisa after casting his vote. The MDC leader took a swipe at the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) that has said his Press conference held on Sunday was illegal. ZEC have even gone as far as reporting Chamisa to the police for what they term flouting of the electoral law. "They (ZEC) do not know the law. They will be taught the law and are just doing the bidding on behalf of Mr Mnangagwa. I am not even going to entertain their tomfoolery," said Chamisa. He accused ZEC of political mischief and said his press conference was no different from that the Zanu PF leader held on Sunday night. Still, the election fever has gripped Zimbabwe with queues getting longer at polling stations around the country. About 5.7million  people are expected to cast their votes in the harmonised elections to choose a new President, Members of Parliament and councillors. The Star
