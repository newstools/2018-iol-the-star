To drive awareness and start conversations around the widespread problem of labelling and stereotyping, Castle Lager has launched a new anti-prejudice movement called #SmashTheLabel. The campaign aims to call on South Africans to be proactive and stand against any form of negative stereotyping and labelling of each other. Castle Lager is encouraging the nation to share a beer. The campaign was launched at Constitution Hill yesterday afternoon where there was a panel discussion facilitated by radio and television personality Anele Mdoda. Mdoda spoke to upcoming poet living with albinism Boitumelo “Gaddafi da Poet” Mainganya, plus-sized model and photographer Lesego “Thickleeyoncé” Lebogane, wheelchair tennis player and 2018 Wimbledon semi-finalist Kgothatso Montjane and Springbok and Blue Bull fly-half Handré Pollard to discuss the challenges they’ve faced being labelled and stereotyped. Former commissioner of the SA Human Rights Commission Lindiwe Mokate discussed the importance of unity in South Africa. Mokate said rather than disappearing, the labelling seems to be getting worse in society. Castle Lager brand manager Vaughan Croeser said the brand was important to the conversation, because it was South African and cared about social cohesion, belonging, and it wanted to bring people together. “When you have a beer with someone, some barriers come down and we connect a little more. I believe if you have a beer with someone, it is a way for us to smash a label and break a stereotype,” he said. To show solidarity with those who have been labelled and raise awareness, Castle Lager is to remove its front body label in a limited edition of label-free packs on September 14 to start the conversation. @Chulu_M
