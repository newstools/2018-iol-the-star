Johannesburg - The taxi driver arrested for allegedly knocking down a traffic officer and assaulting her now faces a more serious charge. Khulani Dludlu appeared briefly in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday and faces a charge of attempted murder. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had initially charged him with assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm following the brutal attack in Houghton, Joburg, on Friday. “We decided to change the charges after we received more information on the case and following further investigations,” said NPA South Gauteng spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane. She said the NPA was not ruling out the possibility of making further arrests in the matter. “We are also not ruling out the possibility of additional charges,” Mjonondwane said. Female traffic officer Nompumelelo Salley was on duty with her colleagues when she stopped a white Toyota minibus and Dludlu allegedly started swearing at her. “When the officer turned her back to direct traffic, the taxi driver accelerated and smashed into the officer. The female officer had to hold on to the windscreen wipers to refrain from been dragged underneath the taxi,” said Johannesburg Metro Police Department Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar at the time. Dludlu, originally from KwaZulu-Natal, was arrested but not after he and other taxi drivers intimidated traffic officers at the scene. He is currently out on R1000 bail and is expected to appear in court again next month. @smashaba
