Shortly after 80-year-old retired sergeant João Rodrigues made his first court appearance for the 1971 murder of Ahmed Timol, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said it was also eyeing other unsolved cases. The Timol case has been hailed as historic, as it dispelled claims by the apartheid regime that some activists had committed suicide in custody. Judge Billy Mothle ruled in the high court in Pretoria last year that Timol was killed by members of the security branch and did not commit suicide by jumping from the 10th floor of John Vorster Square 46 years ago. Judge Mothle overturned a 1972 inquest that claimed Timol jumped to his death. He recommended the prosecution of Rodrigues, who was present when Timol died. “Rodrigues, on his own version, participated in the cover-up to conceal the crime of murder as an accessory after the fact, and went on to commit perjury by presenting contradictory evidence before the 1972 and 2017 inquests,” Judge Mothle said. “He should accordingly be investigated with a view to his prosecution,” was his finding. The NPA has now slapped Rodrigues with charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. Rodrigues handed himself over yesterday morning at the same venue, now named Johannesburg Central police station, where Timol and several others met their deaths. Hours after being charged at the station, Rodrigues applied for bail in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. He cited old age among grounds for bail. Bail was set at R2000. @BonganiNkosi87
