Johannesburg - Sipho Mdletshe, the man who allegedly gunned down the mother of his teenage son in broad daylight in May, has abandoned his bail application and will go straight to trial. This emerged on Thursday morning at the Protea Magistrate's Court in Soweto; the township where Mdletshe is alleged to have fired three shots at close range, which killed Nomsa Mbuyisa, the mother of his 19-year-old son. Mdletshe will await documents to be served on him for the accused to go to the Joburg High Court, where his trial is expected to take place.Â The alleged murderer is also accused to have shot Nomsa's older brother, Dumi, on his right leg. Dumi, according to the victim's family, was trying to save his sister, after Mdletshe had fired the third shot in Nomsa's head. Nomsa's family and friends were out in numbers on Thursday, calling on the community to fight the scourge of femicide. Lindiwe Mazibuko, Nomsa's younger sister, implored women to leave their abusive partners, saying the signs were all there to see.      "It starts with a simple swear word. Those are the signs which show that the man is abusive. Please, women should not be afraid to seek help from family once you realise that you're in trouble," an emotional Mazibuko pleaded. Murder accused Mdletshe will remain in custody until his next appearance in August, where the high court documents are expected to have been given to him.@khayakoko88 khaya.koko@inl.co.za The Star
