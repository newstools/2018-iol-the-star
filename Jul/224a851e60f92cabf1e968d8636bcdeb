Johannesburg - Kwaito musician and alleged domestic violence offender, Arthur Mafokate has withdrawn from the #100MenMarch held in Pretoria today. This follows reports that the government communications and information system (GCIS) did not invite the musician to be part of the #100MenMarch, an anti-child and women abuse event. Mafokate is currently on trial for the alleged assault of his ex-girlfriend, Busisiwe “Cici” Twala who once said in court that the Kwaito star dragged her alongside his car. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after Twala accused him of assaulting her. “GCIS has not appointed him as an ambassador of the march and strongly condemn any mischievous association of the march with Mr Mafokate,” said the department in a statement. Mafokate has since responded to the reports by withdrawing his participation in the event hosted by government after threats on his life and that of his family. In a statement, Mafokate said: “I have decided to no longer participate in the #100MenMarch to which I was invited to participate through RiSA, SAMRO and SAACYF, due to the opposition I have received from participation as well as threats I, and my immediate family, have received.” He further said that he remained resolute in supporting of women and children and all activities in combating gender violence and abuse. “That I stand accused of having perpetrated violence against a woman doesn't mean I am guilty thereof,” he said. The march is aimed at the highlighting the voice of men as crucial in ending the scourge of violence against women and children. It also serves as an invitation to all men and boys to respond to the “Send Me – Thuma Mina” call and take a stand against the scourge of violence and abuse.  @Zwane_2Li2Ls  The Star
