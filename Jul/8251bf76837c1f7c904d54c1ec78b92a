Thereâ€™s no running involved, so all your energy can be used for chatting up a storm and getting to know people along the way. The walk has grown from just a small initiative to the biggest walk in the country. It has seen more than 50000 people come together to exercise and sightsee through the city. From the early morning start, the walk takes people through the lush green of Emmarentia, and along Empire Road, then through the pathways of Wits University and onto the iconic Nelson Mandela bridge. Walking through the CBD isn't something people do regularly, so when in large groups, they have the opportunity to see it for what it is. Thousands participate on the The 702 Walk the Talk. For the 15km walkers, the route also takes in the scenic roads of Braamfontein through Constitution Hill and back down to Emmarentia before heading back to Marks Park, where they can catch up more with friends, family and colleagues. A 15km stretch may seem like a lot but in fact even a child can cover it. This year just over 17000 people took the 15km option. Starting at 7am, walkers could get in their morning walk with a tingling breeze to really wake them up. But as the walk progresses, the body heat kicks in and it soon becomes a real exercise and a good way to lose calories. The sun does eventually come out, just in time to enjoy the last half of the walk. With several water and energy-drink spots in evidence, music blaring through speakers and cheerleaders along the way, this walk is an absolute pleasure. If the 15km option isn't for you, there was also the option of the 8km and 5km fun walks. @mane_mpi
