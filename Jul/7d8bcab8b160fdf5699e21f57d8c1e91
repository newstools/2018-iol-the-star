Motsepe said she was delighted that the first lady of China had come to the community to highlight the importance of early childhood development. Peng cheerfully told the children: “You are all welcome to visit China.” As they welcomed the visitors waving South Africa and China's flags, the children were also taught a few Chinese phrases. The youngsters showed the first ladies, through a song, what they had learnt about safety and reporting sexual abuse of any kind. The daycare's owner and principal, Alicia Shongwe, said she felt honoured that God had remembered her 22 years after she had opened her centre, with just two children. Shongwe said having not only one but two first ladies visiting was something that she would cherish for the rest of her life. “This has motivated me, and I want the opportunity to build an even bigger daycare centre on the vacant land in the area. "We have a lot of children here because the parents see something special in our centre.” Shongwe was also grateful for the various donations made during the visit, as they would make a significant difference to the children in her care, she said. The centre received a fridge, stationery, toys, blankets as well as floor mats, so that the children are spared the cold concrete floor. “I now know more about BRICS, and I hope that many more communities will benefit from the collaboration of the two countries,” Shongwe said.
