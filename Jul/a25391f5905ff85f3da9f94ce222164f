The global call to action that celebrates the idea that individuals have the power to transform the world for the greater good was a platform for Miss Soweto Busisiwe Mmotla and White Star Super Maize Meal to get involved. As a qualified teacher who values the importance of education, the reigning queen undertook a national book drive to provide books for the learners of her former primary school in Zola, Soweto. The books were collected from the community, including donations from Nal’ibali, Read A Book SA, and even former Kaizer Chiefs and Sundowns goalkeeper Brian Baloyi. The Luyolo Primary School library was in much need of a revamp, so the library was repainted and the floor tiles were replaced. “What better way to encourage the young to fall in love with education than by equipping them with the tools they need?" said Mmotla. "My title as the reigning Miss Soweto 2017 gave me the platform to engage with the youth to impart my learnings as a role model to those who come after me,” she added. White Star marketing manager Mokhele Makhothi said: “By providing learning materials and food for schools and communities, we are assisting in helping everyone achieve their full potential. "It's up to brands such as White Star to groom our future generations, while utilising education as a cornerstone for success,” he said.
