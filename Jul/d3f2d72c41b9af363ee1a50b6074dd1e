The original verified website then everything will follow through. I am very cautious about those things.  How many phones do you have? And do they have passwords? I only have one phone. Itâ€™s an iPhone X. Over the years I used to have many phones, but I thought it is stupid for me. If I give you my number then it means I want you to have my numbers, and chances are, you will use them. I got a password.  Do you use the same password to log into all your social media platforms? No. I use different passwords because if someone gets access to that password, then they have access to your social media accounts and personal information.

What are your thoughts about how South African celebrities use social media? I think we are learning as we go. I think social media is learning from us. Social media platforms are learning human behaviour as it goes, and we are learning the platforms as they grow, enhance and develop. I think human behaviour, because largely it is based on emotions, it is always interesting in the way it changes. People were less cautious about what they say on social media, but now they are more cautious because your employer can fire you because of what you say on social media. @SthembisoMedia
