Johannesburg - The mysterious disappearance of a Joburg high school principal has not affected teaching amid angst within the institution regarding the suspicious incident. Phillip du Plessis, headmaster at Sandringham High School, did not report to work on Tuesday morning when Gauteng schools reopened for the academic year's third term, which prompted the school's management to contact district authorities as well as police. This was according to spokesperson for Education MEC Panyazi, Steve Mabona, who was with the MEC at the school on Thursday on an oversight visit to allay fears at the school, including offering psychological support if necessary, and engaging learners. Du Plessis was last seen at Carnival City in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, where video footage showed him arriving with the school car, but it's unclear whether he ever left the premises. Captain L van Staad only confirmed that a missing person inquest had been opened at the Boksburg North police station. @khayakoko88  khaya.koko@inl.co.za  The Star
