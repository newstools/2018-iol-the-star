Busisiwe "Cici" Twala was found not guilty of assaulting her former lover Arthur Mafokate at the Midrand Magistrate's Court on Monday. During a lengthy judgement given by Magistrate Lieland Poonsamy, he ruled that the statement given by her ex-lover was vague and did not mention the various claims of assault. Both Mafokate and Twala had opened counter cases of assault against each other over an incident that happened early last year. Poonsamy said Mafokate revealed during cross examination that he had been assaulted with a chair, coat hanger and bitten on the arm by the Twala after an altercation which transpired at his home in Midrand. Mafokate maintained that their argument was a result of cheating suspicions from Twala. He also said the attack led to him seeking medical attention which was verified by a doctor who found that there was some tenderness or bump on his arm and head. Poonsamy said the doctor was fast to make a ruling with regards to the evidence given. “When I looked at the statement it is vague and it could not have given the the State the position to proceed with the assault case after receiving verification with regards to the statement,” he said. “When one reads it, it is not clear if there was an assault. Only evidence to the assault itself was reveal under cross examination,” he said. “Proceeding with caution then the benefit of the doubt was given in this regard. The accused is therefore found not guilty of the set charge,” Poomsamy ruled. Twala was accompanied by her mother Thandi Twala.       The relief of winning the case may be short lived as Twala will be making her way back to court, on August 23, for her case against Mafokate for dragging her alongside his car. As a result she said the assault led to her having a hip replacement and had to walk on crutches. Mafokate pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. @Zwane_2Li2Ls
