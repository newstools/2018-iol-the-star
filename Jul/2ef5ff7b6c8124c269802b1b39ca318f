JOHANNESBURG- The 702 Walk the Talk is a good excuse to not only walk through the streets of Johannesburg freely but to also catch up with friends. There's no running involved so all your energy can  be used up chatting up a storm and getting to know people along the way. The walk has grown from just a small initiative to one of the biggest walks in the country that's sees over 50 000 people come together to exercise and sightsee through the city. From the early morning start, the walk takes people through the lush green of  Emmarentia, the concrete roads of Empire Road, through the pathways of Wits University and onto the iconic Nelson Mandela bridge. Walking through the CBD is not something people do on the regular so when in large groups they have the opportunity to see it for what it is. For the 15km walkers, the route also takes the scenic roads of Braamfontein through Constitution Hill and back to Emmarentia before returning to Marks Park-where the walk started- to catch up even more with friends, families and colleagues. A 15km stretch may seem like a lot but in fact even a child can cover the time if they walk on pace with parents in tow. This year, just over 17 000 people took on the 15km option. Starting at 7am, walkers could get in their morning walk with a tingling breeze to really wake them up. But as the walk progresses, the body heat kicks in and it soon becomes a real exercise and a good count on the loss of calories. The sun does eventually come out just on time to enjoy the last half of the walk. With several water and energy drink spots along the way, music blaring through speakers and cheerleaders along the way, this walk is an absolute pleasure to take part in. The Star
