 How many smartphones do you own? Which brands? One phone - Samsung.  Do you have a security password for your smartphone? Yes. My whole life is on my phone. If I could have five passwords I would.  How often do you like people’s Instagram posts? Too much.  What features do you think Facebook should add? Ooh tough one, guys, I’m more of an Instagram girl, to be honest - they are the same family though, so IG, Keep up the GREAT WORK!  How much airtime do you have now on your smartphone? R189 airtime. 5 gigs data.  Do you buy data via your bank app or do you use cash? By the app - super convenient.   Do you think it's necessary for heads of state to know technology and be active on social media? Yes - but there is danger in the misuse of Twitter. So as long as it’s monitored, it’s a great idea.  What gadget would you buy for President Cyril Ramaphosa? This is hilarious! How random?! Maybe a GoPro, he’s travelling tons and meeting the most powerful people in the world - that would make for an epic vlog!  Have you ever had a twar (Twitter war) with anyone? No, not yet - touch wood!! I try to engage as much as possible with my amazing followers. If you tweet or comment something mean, I just ignore it.  Do you download movies online? Which ones have you recently downloaded? I don’t have wifi at my new place yet, so I’m relying on the kindness of my colleagues to give me movies! I recently got a bunch of REALLY OLD movies - Boyz’ *  the Hood! Watch it - it’s a classic for a reason!! The cast is amazing!  Do you book a seat online before watching a movie? I go straight to the movies - but I’m there super early to buy tickets, so a good seat is guaranteed. @SthembisoMedia
