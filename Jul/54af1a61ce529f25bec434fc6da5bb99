So, when I was asked to review the new Powerbeats Wireless earphones, I was keen to bring an end to a tiresome fight with my beloved iPhone earphones. With smooth red-and-black earpods and just one cord that connects the two speakers, I immediately knew that my listening experiencing would be changed forever. Powerbeats are a must for music lovers as well as those who require privacy to enjoy a playlist of podcasts at work, the gym or while doing some shopping. I loved how they have clear signs of which speaker fits into which ear (right or left). We often underestimate this, but it certainly makes a difference to one’s listening experience and comfort because they don’t constantly fall off. The sound is impressive and the feature of blocking out surrounding sound allows for a better listening experience. The Powerbeats’ easy connection is enabled by the Bluetooth feature. All you need to do is pair the beats to your phone - a process that takes a few seconds.  You can keep the Powerbeats connected to your phone throughout the day, as the device’s control button allows you to receive calls. The battery life for the pods is good and allows you to enjoy up to 12 hours of undisrupted connection. The best thing about Powerbeats is that they are sweat resistant. This is a big deal for me after a horrible experience of finding out one of my old earphones had malfunctioned following a sweat-filled workout at the gym. I have been able to use the Powerbeats while busy with daily activities, but I was disappointed that the device does not enable you to connect to a laptop that does not have a Bluetooth connection. It would be great if this feature could be added as it would allow for a holistic listening experience. So, music lovers and gym fanatics, go and get your Powerbeats for a life-changing hearing experience. @ZintleMahlati
