I have never been to FNB Bellville and am shocked to learn someone is earning commission on my Discovery subscriptions. Apparently, this person was appointed in 2010. I have never signed a paper appointing a broker to my Discovery account. I have asked for advice several times regarding the scheme I am on from Discovery and received no reply. I would like all payments from 2010 to be refunded to me and this person’s name taken off my subscription immediately. I am totally shocked at this news. Discovery responds: “Thank you for contacting us regarding your concern with the broker linked to your Discovery Health membership. “When you joined your company in August 2000, your employer appointed a broker to your policy. "He then left FNB, and FNB requested Discovery to transfer his Discovery Health clients to another FNB adviser, effective April 1, 2010, which is how he got linked to your Discovery Health membership and remained the broker on record ever since. "We are in the process of transferring your Discovery Health membership directly to Discovery with no broker, and if need be, we can get a broker who is closer to where you live to assist you with any advice. "However, regrettably we are unable to assist you with any refund of commission as the commission that was paid to the broker was not taken directly from your premium, and your premium remains the same with or without a broker.” * Georgina Crouth is a consumer watchdog with serious bite.
