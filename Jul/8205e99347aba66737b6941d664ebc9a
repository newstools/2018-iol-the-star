Eastern Cape - The MTN Foundation will on Friday handover toilets in Bizana at Luna Primary School. This is to prevent further deaths after that of five-year-old Lumka Mkhethwa, who fell into a pit latrine at her school in Bizana in March. Acting Judge Nomawabo Msizi found that the regulations relating to Minimum Uniform Norms and Standards for Public School ­Infrastructure were fraught with unconstitutional loopholes and vagueness, in a matter heard in the Eastern Cape High Court in Bhisho. MTN says the initiative is part of the Mandela centenary celebrations and part of their "21 days of yellow care" campaign. The organisation donates school computer labs, uniforms and bicycles to the needy during the duration.

The 23-year-old gave birth to another child in June. Mkhethwa said the void of not having her child was something that was visible to her everyday life. "I don't even have anyone to prepare to go to school or cleanup after. I'm bored with my life," she said speaking to The Star. On the day of her daughter's death she thought Lumka took a different transport or got lost but police delivered the bad news the following day after a Grade 1 learner saw Lumka's jersey in the toilet.      "Lumka was a dedicated and hardworking girl. I pray God gives gives her (mother) a new one. I'm thankful that God gave her a new baby but it's still painful. You can see the pain in her eyes. We are still pining but grateful to MTN for this," said Ntombekhaya Mtsheke.
