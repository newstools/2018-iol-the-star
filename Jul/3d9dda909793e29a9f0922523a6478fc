Johannesburg - Police Minister Bheki Cele said it looks like the ANC man arrested for a  cash-in-transit heist was a habitual criminal who had been wanted for other crimes. Cele was speaking on Bongani Bingwa's Radio 702 breakfast show on Thursday morning. "The arrest of Errol Velile Present is the arrest of just another criminal. What we have established is that Velile is linked to another cash heist [that happened] before this, other cases and drunken driving." Cele also said Present has been arrested before for other crimes but never attended court processes. He noted that it looked like Present was a habitual criminal and that he should be investigated and will definitely be. Present is alleged to have been part of a group of people involved in a cash-in-transit heist in Dobsonville, Soweto on July 4. Cele said their crack team that was put together to look into cash-in-transit heists has so far arrested many people involved in these crimes in Boksburg and Limpopo. "We have arrested more 40 people. Some of them are on the high list of being wanted. Some are experts on this thing, we arrested two blasters and fortunately or unfortunately both are from Botswana." "We also arrested a 67-year-old man. If you become part of crime it does not matter who you are, how old you are... we'll find you and put you where you belong." The Star
