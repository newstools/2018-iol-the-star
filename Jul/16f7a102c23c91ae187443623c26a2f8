I am beating my head against a brick wall with Telkom, It should really be a simple matter, not in the least bit complicated. I moved from Port Elizabeth in September 2016 (now residing in Gauteng) and requested the service to be cancelled. I submitted the necessary form with a copy of my ID. All this has been acknowledged by Telkom, and yet I regularly receive a monthly statement for the rental of the service - no call charges, just the rental. I have been told many times and by many people that the matter will be sorted out, my account will be cancelled and all amounts will be reversed. At one point I got to the stage where almost the entire amount was reversed - R4499.89 of R5042.32 - but the account was not cancelled, as I have since been receiving regular monthly statements, and the total has now reached R2195.05. For at least the last six months I have been told that the problem is probably that my account has been “migrated” to a new system - but how that would prevent Telkom from cancelling my account I don’t know - and besides, the system by now surely must have been bedded in. I’m told the call centre operator will “escalate” the matter, but nothing gets resolved. I have correspondence and accounts and the names of people I’ve spoken to. Telkom says: “The account has been cancelled and the customer will be credited accordingly.” * Georgina Crouth is a consumer watchdog with serious bite.
