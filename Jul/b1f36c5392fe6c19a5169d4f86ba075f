Johannesburg - Fancy being a multimillionaire? Well, a cool R61 million awaits a lucky player as the National Lottery has confirmed that the huge amount is Friday’s PowerBall jackpot. There is also an estimated R11m in the PowerBall Plus, taking the estimated potential winnings for Friday’s draw to over R70m. According to Naledi Masopha, the public relations manager at lottery operators Ithuba, mega jackpots such as the one on Friday, as always, are won only by those who try their luck. “Since Ithuba Holdings took over the operation of the National Lottery, 77 people have won either the PowerBall or PowerBall Plus jackpots, of which seven winners were over R50m jackpot wins. This number excludes all the other jackpot winners on other games offered by the National Lottery,” Masopha said. She added that the operating company was aware that people are often overwhelmed when they suddenly come into a sizeable windfall, and Ithuba had established mechanisms which assisted the recipients of large amounts on dealing with their windfall. “All jackpot winners are offered financial advice by accredited financial advisers, arranged by Ithuba, free of charge to the winner,” Masopha said. The winners also receive trauma counselling from psychologists to help them deal with the life-changing experience. This is at no cost to the winner,” Masopha noted. The Star
