Media personality Redi Tlhabi kicked off the first ever Marie Claire Power Summit embracing Mandela Day and saying the event was honouring him and taking his legacy forward.   The event, taking place at Gold Reef City on Wednesday morning was an empowering, educational and equipping summit that aims to impart knowledge and power to people's careers and lives. The panel discussions will take on politics, beauty, environment and business. Tlhabi said it was important to discuss women's roles in the economy and that tackling social ills was the only way to create empowerment.  "Women are the largest economic force and yet we seldom have a say in decisions." Tlhabi said keeping Mandela in mind, women should ask themselves how they could be the solution to the many problems facing the country.   The keynote address was given by Jane Raphaely, chairman of Associated Media Publishing. She spoke on the power of the female economy while actress Nomzamo Mbatha spoke on the topic 'No shortcut to success' . Mbatha said everyday when she wakes up, she is thankful that she is able to do what she dreamed of. "It would be such a shame to wake up and serve something that does nothing that served us. I'm grateful I have that. I hope that each and every day you wake up you buy yourself the choice to do something not on circumstance but on choice." Other speakers expected to give addresses and take part in the panel discussions for the day were Terry Pheto, Phuti Mahanyele, Koleka Putuma, Lindiwe Mazibuko, Panashe Chigumadzi. Other topics to be discussed include 'Speaking Politics: A crash course in being in power" and "CAN Africa Redefine luxury to the world".  The summit continues. @mane_mpi
