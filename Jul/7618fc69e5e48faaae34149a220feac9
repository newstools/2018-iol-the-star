JOHANNESBURG- Johannesburg City Library workers locked the public out on Monday morning, angry over the alleged illegal docking of salaries and unpaid overtime. Employees claimed that they had hit a brick wall and were left with no option but to close the library to express their frustrations. Some of the people who arrived at the library said they were not aware that there was a shutdown. The operating hours are from 9am but the gates were opened only just before 10.30am. Paseka Modibedi, 31, said she arrived at the library at 8.30am to find the doors locked. “I was expecting that they would open at 9am but the gates were still locked. I asked the security guards and they told us that there was a shutdown. He could not tell us when the library would be open,” Modibedi said. She said she had traveled from Orange Farm and was at the library to meet her tutor who lives in North Riding. “Coming here is convenient for both of us. Now that it is closed, I don't know what we are going to do,” she said. Among those waiting idly outside the library were a group of chemical and electrical engineering students. “We meet at the library to study together and help each other out. Now that the library has been closed, I don't know how we are going to study. If they don't open, it will be a day wasted,” said Thokozani Makhubo. Pride Tshabalala, a senior assistant at the library, said monies were being deducted from their salaries every month and there was no explanation for that. “When we go to HR (human resources), we are told to speak to our line manager. We now want answers. Our salaries are being docked and we are not paid for overtime,” Tshabalala said. She said their roster contradicted their actual register. Tshabalala said due to the extended operating hours, employees were forced to work on Saturdays but were not paid for it. “You are instead told to take a day off,” said another employee Sifiso Mbambo.
