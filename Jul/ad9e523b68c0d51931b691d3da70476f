JOHANNESBURG- Graca Machel and other congregants gathered at a Soweto church on Sunday to reminisce, reflect and celebrate Nelson Mandela's life in prayer and song. The Methodist Church of Southern Africa in Orlando, Soweto, was full to capacity as it held a special service to remember the life of the struggle stalwart in honour of his centenary celebrations. While the entire Mandela family was invited to the event, Graca was the only who showed up as it was explained that the others could not make it, citing the centenary celebrations that they had been busy with throughout the week. Bishop Ziphozihle Siwa said the sentimental service was to remember the greatest gift the God gave South Africa. “Mandela was a man who was amongst the suffering. Even in death, his life continues to inspire and empower the nation. It is in our hands to make the world a better place. Let us commit to this and allow God to us and work through us,” he said. Siwa also said Mandela’s life reflected unconditional love because of the sacrifices he made and the pain he endured through his life fighting for South Africa's freedom. He also said people needed to find their inner Mandela. “We need to recognise the trail of bitterness and hatred that makes us to live in prison. We must abandon life destroying tendencies and find the Mandela inside us. God has created all that we need. The only thing that prolongs our suffering is because we do not share our God given abilities. People live in spaces that rob them of their dignity,” he added.
