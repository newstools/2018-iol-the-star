Masekela’s music and activism shared much with the values Madiba espoused throughout his life and leadership. Their two legacies are connected by key themes and experiences of their lives. They both gave their lives to a vision of a free South Africa united in its cultural diversity. While Madiba was imprisoned and unable to be with his people for 27 years, Masekela was exiled and not allowed to come home for much of his life. In 1987, the ace trumpeter Masekela wrote and performed the anthemic song that called for the release of the then imprisoned Madiba Bring Him Back Home - Nelson Mandela. The Orbit Jazz Club in Braamfontein, Joburg will pay homage to the two tomorrow with musicians who played with Masekela. Performing his iconic hits, their performance will celebrate Bra Hugh’s life and highlight the richness of his musical contribution to the world. Led by trumpeter and composer Sydney Mavundla, who will be playing a flugelhorn gifted to him by Bra Hugh, the band will also feature bassist Fana Zulu, drummer Leeroy Sauls and vocalist Gugu Shezi, who formed part of Masekela’s inner circle of collaborators during his last decade. “Bra Hugh lived a life that spanned five continents over eight decades. He was exiled from the country of his birth for much of his adult life. “His love and commitment to the people of South Africa remained central to his music and human rights activism. Just like Madiba, he lived for his people. “It is, therefore, fitting that we invoke his contribution as we celebrate Madiba’s life,” executive producer Leo Phiri said. The Hugh Masekela Heritage Foundation said: “It’s important for us to highlight the immensity of Hugh Masekela’s life and values. He was much more than a musician. “His commitment to human rights and contribution to the Struggle for freedom embodied much of the features that define Madiba’s vision.” Tickets cost R250 per person.
