JOHANNESBURG- An unidentified man died on top of a Metrorail train at the Eatonside station, Sebokeng after being electrocuted while allegedly train surfing.  The incident happened on Saturday morning around 11:00 where the man was allegedly burnt by +3000 volt cables. After the train came to a standstill, many people went closer and took pictures of his charred remains.  Gauteng Metrorai's Lillian Mofokeng confirmed the incident and that a single railway line was used to move other trains and avoid any more disruptions to train operations.  Sebokeng police spokesperson Sergeant Thembeka Koago, however, could not confirm the incident occur, saying she was not aware of it.  Images of the victim’s charred body with his leg sticking up have been circulating around social media since Saturday morning. Mofokeng said train surfing was an illegal act done mostly by young people. According to her, train surfing was mostly prevalent in Gauteng West and South.  In September last year, a school boy from Tembisa fell from a moving train and died while surfing. The 17-year-old’s dead body was found next to the railway line in the early morning. In November, an unidentified man died on top of a Metrorail train Nyanga station, Cape Town after being electrocuted. The incident caused a two-hour long delay to rail operations in and out of the station.  Mofokeng said Metrorail was currently running safety campaigns to prevent and address train surfing. “Schools and communities are targeted to educate them of the dangers related with train surfing,” she said, adding that random targeted safety patrols were done at high risk areas with law enforcement agencies and undercover securities present to prevent it.
