 In your own words, what is social media? A place where we all connect to share moments in our lives.  Name three social media platforms that you prefer? Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.  How is your relationship with your followers on social media? I try to keep it about my work and less about my personal stuff, and I try to interact with them as much as possible.  What are your thoughts on internet trolls and how do you respond to them? I block and move on with my life.  What are your thoughts on fake ­Twitter accounts, and what do you think should be done about them? They are a hiding place for people who don’t have the guts to say what they want to say, and they must be blocked.   What type of phone are you using and what do you like most about it? iPhone X; the picture quality. ALSO READ: #TechFriday Celeb Kutloano Nhlapo  What makes a smartphone bad, and why? A phone that has a weak battery and one that freezes. That inconvenience is not needed in life. LOL!  Which network provider do you think needs to improve its services? Telkom Mobile; it’s cheaper, but the network is bad in some places.  Do you do internet banking, and how has the experience been? Yes, it’s the best thing that has ever happened.  Before you buy a gadget, what are some of the key things that you look out for? How long will I use this for.  Do you have games in any of your gadgets? If yes, please name them. I only have FIFA for my PlayStation.  Which game would you recommend to a friend? FIFA, LOL!  Would you ever buy a drone? Why? I’ve actually bought one, because when they first came out people were charging too much for us to rent, so I ended up buying one to save that cost for my events. @SthembisoMedia
