Johannesburg - It has emerged that Duduzane Zuma was briefly detained by the Hawks at OR Tambo International Airport on his arrival back in the country on Thursday night. Duduzane's lawyer Rudi Krause confirmed to Independent Media that his client was flagged when he landed at the airport, but he said it's unclear why he was detained. Krause said Duduzane was detained for 2 hours and that there was no warrant of arrest for him. The Hawks were present at the airport at the time. "There is no warrant of arrest out for him and no one should say there is. There was no warrant of arrest he was detained briefly when he arrived," said Krause. Duduzane is believed to be in the country to attend his brother Nhlakanipho Zuma's funeral on Saturday. The NPA confirmed earlier this week that Duduzane had been summoned to appear in court on July 12. He is facing two charges of culpable homicide for a 2014 accident that killed Phumzile Dube. Krause confirmed that his client will appear in court next week. @ZintleMahlati @SthembisoMedia IOL
