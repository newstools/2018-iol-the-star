Trevor Noah issued an "unofficial apology" following the backlash he received online after a video of him making fun of Aboriginal women surfaced online. Responding to a Twitter user on Sunday, Noah wrote: "After visiting Australia's Bunjilaka museum and learning about Aboriginal history first hand I vowed never to make a joke like that again. And I haven't. I'll make sure the clip from 2013 is not promoted in any way." British journalist Piers Morgan, who has previously gone tweet to tweet with Noah, is not going quietly into the night and has called for an official apology. Taking to Twitter, in series of tweets, Piers compares Noah's joke to Roseanne Barr's racist tweets, which resulted in her TV show being cancelled. He also questioned Comedy Central about why Noah hasn't been asked to apologise.      Piers' rant got Noah's fans up in arms, with many accusing him of not knowing what a joke is and seemingly have more than a bone to pick with Noah. See some their comments below.                                    Noah and Morgan have previously been at loggerheads after the "Daily Show" host critiqued Morgan's interview with US President Donald Trump in January. Noah accused Morgan of throwing his journalist handbook out the window when it comes to dealing with Trump — he also called him an "an unf#ckable Colin Firth". Morgan responded by calling Noah "not as funny as Jon Stewart".
