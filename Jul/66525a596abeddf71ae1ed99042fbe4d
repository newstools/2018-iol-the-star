Johannesburg - Motorists have been urged to use alternative roads ahead of the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture at the Wanderers Stadium in Illovo on Tuesday. The lecture, in partnership with the Motsepe Foundation, is to be delivered by former US president Barack Obama. Over 15 000 people, including world leaders, ministers and members of the public are expected to attend the lecture. The Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture is one of the foundation’s flagship programmes to honour the struggle icon. Every year since 2003 global leaders have used the lecture to raise topical issues affecting South Africa, Africa and the rest of the world. Roads leading to the venue have been closed to the general public and only accredited vehicles will be allowed. The road closure starts from the corner of Corlett Drive and Rudd Road and continues all the way down Corlett Drive up to Irene Road. The Nelson Mandela Foundation said it is ready for the special event. Speaking to the Star, Nelson Mandela Foundation Director of Communications Luzuko Koti said they started making preparations in 2017. “The venue, Wanderers Cricket Stadium has been converted where people can sit and listen to the lecture. We anticipate that it will be cold but we have prepared things,” Koti said. “We are ready as we can be. I think we have been working on this project for the past year. Remember when we closed last year’s lecture, we started with this one. We worked on contextualising the message and so on, but closer to the time, we started working on logistics. Looking at how people will be affected. People living in Joburg, where would it be and what the elements are that need to be put in place. And all of those elements are in place."
