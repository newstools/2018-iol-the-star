Johannesburg - The man who allegedly accidentally shot and killed his son at Fred Norman Secondary School in Ennerdale appeared at the Lenasia Magistrate Court on Tuesday morning. Sibusiso Tshabalala, 51, who is facing a murder charge, was expected to appear before Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe. Though Tshabalala previously appeared in court with his wife, he was alone at Tuesday’s proceedings. The father of four wore a navy beanie, brown hoodie over a black shirt, checked pants and sneakers. Tshabalala shot his son Luyanda,16 at Fred Norman Secondary School in Ennerdale on June 5. In a sworn affidavit during his bail application, Tshabalala maintained that he shot his son by mistake after he was woken up by a tapping sound at the window of his car. Thinking he was being hijacked, he said he pulled out his licenced firearm and shot in the direction of the sound, not knowing it was his son who he had been waiting for to finish his extra classes. Tshabalala said he eventually realised that the person at his door was his son after hearing, “Daddy it’s me.” Previously, Prosecutor Tumi Maunye introduced a letter to the court from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The letter stated that the DPP wants to prosecute Tshabalala in the South Gauteng High Court however the case matter was postponed to 4 September to allow more time for the investigation to be completed. @Chulu_M The Star
