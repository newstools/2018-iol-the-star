An Indonesian teenager was rescued after drifting at sea for 49 days. The teen recounted being chased by a shark and drinking his own sweat to survive, local media reported yesterday. In July, Aldi Novel Adilang, 19, was working on a fish trap 125km off the coast of Indonesiaâ€™s North Sulawesi province when the raft came loose from the seabed. The chaos was caused by a heavy storm that hit the Indonesia province. The 19-year-old was rescued on August 13 off the US territory of Guam by the Panamanian-flagged vessel, MV Arpeggio. Aldi said he survived by eating fish, drinking rain water and his own sweat. He said a shark followed the raft. Adli also said passed by about 10 ships before finally being rescued. His family was overjoyed when they were reunited with him in his hometown of North Minahasa Manado on Sulawesi island on September 8. dpa ANA
