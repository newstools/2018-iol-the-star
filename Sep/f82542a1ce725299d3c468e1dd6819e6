Our group of five couples walked to Mina, a tent city outside Mecca, to start the first day of our pilgrimage. We reached the camp and had barely settled down to have a short rest before we started the dayâ€™s prayers when a large group of our fellow Africans from central Africa practically drove us out of the tent. They said we were not Africans but from Asia because of the colour of our skin. Our pleas for rational dialogue and negotiations to prove we were Africans fell on deaf ears. Without putting up an argument, we willingly gave up our tent and moved to another as we valued our pilgrimage and the prevailing camaraderie more than disagreeing about space. This horrifying experience proves that the effects of ignorance, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance live everywhere, and are not only a South African problem but a global dilemma. There is narrow-mindedness and prejudice out there. It is time we all stood up and took the lead in discussing these social ills. My experience pales in comparison to others, but it is a form of discrimination, and tackling it requires a confession from us all that it exists.
