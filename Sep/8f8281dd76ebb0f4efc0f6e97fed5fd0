Speaker of the city Vasco da Gama said Madikizela-Mandela made sacrifices for the sake of freedom, endured imprisonment and beatings, was separated from her family, yet she endured. "When the dust of the Struggle settled, she emerged with grace and dignity, working to build communities, assist those in need and create a better South Africa." The City of Joburg's Category 1 Award, conferment of the freedom of the city, is recognised as the highest honour that the council can confer upon an individual or group. It has, since 1996, been bestowed posthumously on the late Struggle icons including Nelson Mandela, Dr Beyers Naud√©, Sophie de Bruyn, Lilian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph and Rahima Moosa. @annacox
