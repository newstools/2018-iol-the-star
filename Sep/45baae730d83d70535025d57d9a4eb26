Pupils in the City of Ekurhuleni are set to go head-to-head during a spelling bee competition final, as part of the city's Literacy Month programme. A spelling bee is a game in which the participants compete in spelling words orally. Grades 4 to 6 learners, teachers and parents will converge at the Boksburg Civic Centre this Saturday at 9am to witness the competition among the young spellers. The 12 best spellers were picked from winners of regional spelling bee competitions hosted at libraries. The city's library and information services, in continuation of the Literacy Month activities, launches its “Fine-Free Week”, inviting library users with outstanding library materials to return them to the library between September 15 and September 22 without paying a fine. Residents are encouraged to take membership with local libraries and stand a chance to win great prizes.
