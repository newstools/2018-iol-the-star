Johannesburg - The sordid saga of sex pest Collan Rex is expected to conclude on Thursday when his sentencing proceedings commence. This emerged on Monday morning at the South Gauteng High Court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court, where prosecutor Advocate Arveena Persad said the State was awaiting the finalisation of the probation officer's report before continuing. The report is crucial to sentencing as it includes victim impact statements by social workers. On Friday, Rex, 22, was found guilty on 144 counts of sexual assault, as well as 12 of assault.Â The sex pest, who is a former water polo coach and hostel master at Parktown Boys High School, was convicted of sexual and violent acts he committed on over a dozen schoolboys aged between 13 and 16 in 2015 and 2016 at the school. Phindi Mjonondwane, spokesperson for the Gauteng National Prosecuting Authority, said there weren't any prescribed minimum sentences for sexual assault, and that it was up to the court to impose a sentence it saw fit. However, Mjonondwane said the State would be seeking the harshest possible sentence for the convicted child abuser because, the crimes which Rex committed were of a serious nature. Rex, who also has a previous drug possession conviction from 2014, is still out on bail. @khayakoko88 The Star
