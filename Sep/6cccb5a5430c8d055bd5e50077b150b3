These centres offer small, medium and micro-sized enterprises a single point of entry into the business world by providing them with, among others, information business advice and data on how to start and maintain businesses. The Diepsloot opening follows the launch of two centres in March and July - in Joburg CBD and Roodepoort. The centres are based on a model that is set up to assist emerging entrepreneurs, allowing them to benefit from the services offered, including those from the cityâ€™s department of economic development. A total of 14 opportunity centres are planned to be rolled out by the end of the 2020/21 financial year. MMC for Economic Development Leah Knott said that the development and support of SMMEs and entrepreneurs plays a critical role in assisting the city to achieve its target of a 5% economic growth by 2021, and a reduction in the unemployment rate within Joburg. The initiative has numerous business partners such as the Trust for Urban Housing Foundation, Absa, SA Revenue Service, Productivity SA, the Innovation Hub and Smart Procurement World. Knott says the opportunity centres will serve as a single point of entry for servicing emerging and estab- lished SMMEs geared towards growing their businesses. They will be guided on how to register their businesses and develop business plans, and will be assisted in analysing business models and identifying corrective actions that can help grow and sustain them.
