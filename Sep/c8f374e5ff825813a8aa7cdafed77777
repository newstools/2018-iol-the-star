The release of the frogs in the areas from which their parents originated comes a year after publication of the biodiversity management plan for the Pickersgill’s reed frog (Hyperolius pickersgilli). Last year, the zoo and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife signed an agreement to breed and reintroduce the frog. This entailed collecting wild specimens and breeding them at the zoo to maintain a healthy and genetically diverse “insurance” population. The zoo collected 20 specimens from two sites. About 200 captive-bred offspring were released. “Amphibians play an integral role in most ecosystems but are the most threatened class of vertebrates globally. About one third of all known species are red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This situation is reflected in South Africa, with 30% of the country’s frog species listed under the threatened category,” the department said Overall, 43% of South African frog species are endemic to the country. Of these, 35% are in the threatened category, and all but one of the threatened species are endemics. “The highest species richness for frogs occurs in KwaZulu-Natal, recognised as being important for both frog endemism and high levels of human activity, particularly in the coastal regions.” The small Pickersgill’s reed frog is known to live in a limited and highly fragmented coastal wetland habitat in KwaZulu-Natal, mostly on commercially owned land. Without concerted pro-active conservation intervention it is highly likely to become extinct. The Pickersgill’s reed frog is listed on the IUCN Red Data List and by South Africa’s Threatened or Protected Species Regulations of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act as endangered. The species is KwaZulu-Natal’s only amphibian species with this status.
