 September 8, 2018      Dineo Ranaka with a failed music career and failed fashion line, the very same Dineo who beat up her personal assistant and cursed out her baby daddyâ€™s assistant for doing her job, is calling other woman straatmate? Lol What a joke my darling â€” IG: wandz_m (@Wandz_Mahlangu) 
 September 8, 2018  Unbothered by the fans' reaction, Ranaka doubled down on her comments on air, tweeting that she is not God and that she can talk about Matheba whenever she wanted to.

Ke tshabe go bua ka ena because ena ke mang pila pila?????? https://t.co/K8OBnbqD2Z â€” #BabyMamasFilm (@dineoranaka)
