The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) was shocked and deeply concerned after another Hammanskraal school pupil was caught on video engaging in sexually provocative misconduct. The video was allegedly filmed in February this year but has the Education Department up in arms after it resurfaced on social media on Monday. In the clip a female pupil performs what looks like a lap dance on a male pupil in a classroom at Sikhululekile Secondary School while being cheered on by classmates. She daringly lifts up her school uniform and exposes her underwear as she gyrates on the bemused but unidentified boy. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said the department was disappointed by the conduct of these pupils which has brought the school into disrepute. “Sikhululekile Secondary School is one of our best-performing schools that produces 100% pass rates, especially in mathematics and science. We strongly condemn any acts of misconduct which seek to undermine the dignity of our learning institutions,” said Lesufi. The MEC added that there was a need for parents to play a pivotal role in assisting with issues of pupil discipline in and outside the school environment. The video resurfaced after another female pupil in the same school was suspended after boasting about sex in the first clip, which also went viral. The department confirmed that the 16-year-old pupil in question was suspended for the transgression of the school’s code of conduct by using foul language and promoting engagement in sexual activities. According to GDE spokesperson Steve Mabona, the female pupil had already appeared before a disciplinary committee and was subsequently suspended for five days. Mabona confirmed that investigations were under way regarding the latest video circulating on social media. “It is unfortunate that the learner depicted on the second video is pregnant and currently at home in preparation for giving birth. The disciplinary process will resume on her return,” said Mabona.
