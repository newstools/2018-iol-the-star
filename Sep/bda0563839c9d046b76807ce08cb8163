The campaign, which will run until next month, was launched at Melrose Arch. Senior brand manager Katlego Mahleka said it started the campaign to show that small actions could lead to positive things. Tweeting under the hastag #GoodFollowsGood, South Africans sent out tweets that were transformed into stationery sets for pupils who are part of the Standard Bank Tutuwa-BRIDGE School Programme. The technology powering the Tweet Machine is a customised Python programming script on a master computer, to scrape Twitter and other social media for posts using the #GoodFollowsGood hashtag. The social media posts are fed to a special micro-controller unit, the Raspberry Pi, which sends the appropriate print commands to the 3D printers and laser cutters inside the Standard Bank Tweet Machine. The more messages pushed, the more stationary is created for pupils who need it. The next activations will be held at Singularity U Summit (October 15-18). @SthembisoMedia
