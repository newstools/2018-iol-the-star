The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) is currently investigating a murder allegedly committed by one of its members over a phone call. A police officer based at the Eldorado Park Police Station allegedly murdered his partner Nicolette Manganyi, at her Meredale home on Saturday evening. “It is alleged that the suspect found his wife sitting with a neighbour at their home in Meredale, drinking. He asked her why she was drunk as he knew her to be a Christian but she told him that she also wanted to be happy." "The suspect joined his wife and neighbour in drinking. Apparently a call came through the suspect's phone and they quarreled about the identity of the female caller,” said IPID spokesperson Moses Dlamini. He also said after Manyani became disturbed by the call, she smashed her husband’s phone on the cement floor and commanded him to leave the house. According to Dlamini, the suspect told police that Manyani also attacked him with a knife  and there was a struggle which resulted in a bullet discharged accidentally. The deceased was then hit by the bullet on her upper neck and it exited on the left temple. “The suspect allegedly phoned the ambulance but the deceased was certified dead on their arrival. The suspect was arrested and the IPID took over the investigation. The investigation continues,” said Dlamini.
