Economic Development, Environment, Agriculture and Rural Development MEC Lebogang Maile and Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina said operation O Kae Molao was also meant to bring order and stability in the townships' business landscape. The O Kae Molao campaign will start on September 18. In recent weeks, four people were killed allegedly by foreign nationals who own spaza shops in parts of Soweto and the West Rand when residents went on a looting spree, demanding that the shops shut down. Masina has been leading teams, including police, Ekurhuleni metro police, the departments of health and home affairs, and health inspectors to conduct raids. “We will be embarking on un- announced visits to a number of spaza shops across the length and breadth of the province. Already, the Gauteng provincial government has dispatched a team to monitor and intervene where necessary," Maile and Masina said in a joint statement. “Pilot operations were undertaken within Ekurhuleni from August 30. Over the three-day operation, 51 spaza shops were inspected, with 37 shops closed down for further investigation. Over 25 undocumented immigrants were detained and more than 8 tons of suspicious goods were seized and sent to the health laboratories for testing." The two said the initiative was informed by the latest attacks and looting of businesses owned by foreign nationals in Soweto and elsewhere in the province. They said the actions could partly be attributed to allegations that some of the shops are involved in selling fake and expired products. @smashaba The Star
