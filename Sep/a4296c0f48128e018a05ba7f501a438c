Those people are already facing hurdles brought about by their conditions, so we shouldn’t, as a society, add to their misery. Let’s make them feel useful instead of useless in this world. In soapies, when they need someone who uses a wheelchair, they take someone with no disability to portray that character instead of someone who is in similar condition of disability. I have seen this recently with Uzalo, the drama on SABC 1. This is not on.
