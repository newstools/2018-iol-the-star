#FeesMustFall activist and former Wits SRC president Mcebo Dlamin had some support from fellow Fallists when he appeared at the Johannesburg Magistrate Court on Monday morning. Dlamini is accused of malicious damage to property, theft, possession of a dangerous weapon and public violence, which led to his arrest in 2016. This stems to the violence that broke out during the #FeesMustFall violence at Wits University. During his previous appearance, he arrived late due to his difficulty walking after he had embarked on a 56,6km walk from Wits University to the Union Buildings to deliver a message to President Cyril Ramaphosa. When he appeared in court on Monday, he  stood outside of the courtroom waiting for his legal council to arrive. However, he was not alone. People wearing branding from Wits University and the ANC were present outside the courtroom to support their comrade. One supporter was also seen wearing a “Free Mcebo Dlamini” t-shirt as well. Last month Judge Moses Mavundla ordered that Dlamini pay  Mzwanele Manyi R55 000 in damages for calling him a “lame, lazy, horny stinky old donkey” on a group WhatsApp message. Dlamini also later in one of the WhatsApp messages told Manyi “you deserve to be necklaced”. The court also accepted that this threat was hurtful towards Many and in this regard, the judge awarded him R5 000 in damages. @Chulu_M
