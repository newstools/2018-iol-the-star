Presenting at the Mall of Africa as part of the Edcon and Proudly South African Heritage Fashion Show over the weekend, Tlale’s spring looks stole the show with their effortless chic. Soft prints, warm colours and practical, clean cuts dominated the looks on the runway. Edcon’s Elelwane Pahlana said it was important for people to question what heritage will be left for future generations and what will be done to create jobs for them.      “Heritage Day prompts us to answer these questions. With Proudly South African, we have a common desire to ensure we create jobs by procuring our merchandise locally and encouraging South Africans to buy locally produced goods. “There is a perception that Edgars and Jet buy all their merchandise from China, but contrary to that belief, more than 50% is procured locally.” She added that local farmers in Limpopo were producing all the men’s chinos in stores, as well as the kids’ character T-shirts. Pahlana, who heads divisional executive group transformation and government relations at the company, said localisation in stores was continuing to increase.      “We are definitely proud of both the work we have done and the association with Proudly South African. This second collaboration with them on a Heritage Month fashion show is part of showcasing that partnership. This year, we are including the consumer in a public event to raise awareness and encourage consumers to support the ‘buy local’ movement.” The Design Innovation Challenge students were also showcasing their collections. Sonwabile Ndamase, the designer behind the famous Mandela shirts, previewed his new range - Vukani Range Creations. “These local ranges are an important step towards providing consumers with more local choices in our shops and educating them about the impact that buying local has on job creation and the economy,” said Eustace Mashimbye, the chief executive of Proudly South African. @mane_mpi
