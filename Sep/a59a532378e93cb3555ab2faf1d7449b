Johannesburg - The Gender Equity Office (GEO) at the University of Witwatersrand has hit back at Professor Ivor Chipkin’s claims that the sexual harassment probe against him did not afford him enough time to respond. Last week, the Saturday Star reported that the academic, media commentator and executive director at the Public Affairs Research Institute (PARI) had resigned in the wake of a series of sexual harassment allegations. Chipkin, an Oppenheimer fellow, has held positions at the University of Oxford, Wits University, and University of Cape Town. However, his sudden resignation this month came after an extensive probe by the Wits GEO into his alleged inappropriate conduct. In a response to queries from the Saturday Star, Chipkin said he had immediately stepped away from the workplace after being informed of the allegations in June. He said he was never invited to give his response to the GEO. GEO director Crystal Dicks has dismissed Chipkin’s allegation. “Those accused of committing offences are at all times provided with an opportunity to respond to these allegations before the conclusion of a university investigation. “They are provided with a further opportunity to present their defence during a disciplinary hearing.” She declined to comment further on the Chipkin matter, saying the university guaranteed confidentiality surrounding incidents such as these.
