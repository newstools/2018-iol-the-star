Four children died in two separate shack fires in a space of 24 hours in Alexandra and Kagiso. The first children to die were the ones from Alexandra. Fihlani siblings, Nonhlanhla, 7; Mbali, 6 and Amukekani, 2 as well as their cousin Sandile Ngobeni, 4, died when the shack they were sleeping in caught fire on Sunday morning around 5am. Their mothers, aged 28 and 31 and who are sisters, were arrested and charged with child neglect. Allegations are that they had left the children in the shack and went drinking at a nearby shebeen when the fire broke out. Then on Monday afternoon around 4pm, two siblings aged eight months and two years old died after the shack they were in caught fire in Kagiso Extension 8. It's not known yet if the children were sleeping or playing inside the shack when it went up in flames. Spokesperson for the police, Sergeant Tshepiso Mashele, said the 22 year old mother told the police that she was outside the shack doing the laundry when a passerby alerted her to the fact that the shack was on fire. "She said when she reacted and tried to get into the shack and get her children, it was already late as the fire was also too high and too strong. "The neighbours also tried to put out the fire but could not," Mashele said. It was also not clear as to why the woman had not bee able to smell the smoke nor why only one person who was passing saw that the shack was on fire. Mashele said the woman was still traumatised and police were yet to interview her extensively on the incident.
