Faith Ngwenya, technical executive at the institute, said the organisation observed a dramatic drop in the number of pupils taking accountancy at school. “A significant drain in accounting pupils now will mean far fewer accountants entering the job market down the line,” she said. Statistics from the Department of Basic Education indicate that there has been a steady decrease in the number of pupils taking accounting. In 2013, about 145 427 pupils wrote accounting in matric, but last year only 103 427 wrote the subject and 68 318 passed. Ngwenya said to encourage pupils to take the subject, those with an aptitude for the subject should be quickly identified and encouraged to pursue accountancy as a career. However, the Growth Institute (GI) said while there was reason to worry, there were others ways of entering the accountancy field. GI’s Peter van Nieuwenhuizen said the majority of school-leavers were under the impression that they cannot practise as accountants unless they are chartered accountants. “Also, they are under the impression that they have to be auditors in order to practise as accountants. “The reality is that only 2% of local businesses need the services of auditors. The rest need the services of professional financial accountants. “ Persons with a national diploma in accounting and with recognition from a professional body could create their own accounting practice in line with the body’s mandates,” Van Nieuwenhuizen said.
