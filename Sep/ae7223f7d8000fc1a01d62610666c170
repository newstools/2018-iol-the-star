The sale of Australian higher education institution Monash South Africa (MSA) to a local entity has left students fuming. Students at the Ruimsig, Roodepoort campus on Thursday protested because MSA has been sold to local education group ADvTECH. MSA student representative council member Karabo Mokhomole said: “The whole reason to come to Monash is to get an international degree. Now that the Australian side is moving out of the business, we will be getting a local degree.” ADvTECH say students’ academic qualifications will not be affected. Dr Felicity Coughlan, director of the Independent Institute of Education (IIE), the higher education division of ADvTECH, said: "Students currently registered will get exactly what they signed up for as will students who register in the first semester of 2019. From the second semester, they will be registering under the new institution with the current qualifications offered at MSA as the curriculum."
