Johannesburg - The SA Human Rights Commission said it was pained that 24 years into democracy, babies were still dying due to poor healthcare and poor management in Gauteng. The commission on Wednesday conducted an inspection at Thelle Mogoerane Hospital neonatal unit, where six babies recently died following an outbreak of Klebsiella.

 September 19, 2018  "Further allegations indicate that overcrowding at the hospital's neonatal unit played a key role in the outbreak and spreading of the bacteria," Jones said. He said the commission had found that the outbreak constituted a prima facie violation of the right to access to health care. "The commission conducted its own preliminary assessment and determined that a site visit to the hospital was necessary to establish the causes, failures or omissions that led to the unfortunate deaths of the babies," Jones said. @SthembisoMedia @smashaba The Star
