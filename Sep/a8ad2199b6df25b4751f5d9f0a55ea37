After a successful launch of its first expo in 2017, the Johannesburg Natural Hair Expo is back once again for an even bigger celebration. With its main mission being empowering women through embracing their natural hair, the movement seems to be growing even bigger. The 2018 edition of the expo will take place on September 24 at Constitution Hill and will host an array of local, African and international brands. This year’s “Hair-itage” theme plays an important role as the expo is on Heritage Day, a day when South Africans are encouraged to celebrate their cultures. Attendees are encouraged to wear traditional attire. The general expo includes various natural hair brands. There will also be a kiddies corner for parents who wish to attend with their kids. “We believe in natural beauty. To us, natural beauty is being clear on who you are and falling in love with that person. The way we pursue natural beauty is by embracing and loving our natural hair. We believe our natural hair is a beautiful crown that makes us feel gorgeous, confident, sexy, unfiltered and, most importantly; authentic,” said creative director Itumeleng Mogatusi. Tickets will be available from Quicket, and general tickets will also be available at the door.
