Tragedy struck a Joburg family when two schoolboys died shortly after complaining of abdominal cramps in class. The learners, aged 10 and seven, were siblings who attended Kumalo Primary School in Katlehong. Provincial Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona alleged that, while in the classroom, the older brother complained of stomach cramps and nausea.“The learner was taken to the local clinic. Subsequently, the Grade 1 learner also complained of similar symptoms as the older sibling and was also rushed to the clinic. Both learners were unfortunately certified dead upon arrival at the clinic.” A teacher went to inform the family and witnessed a five-year-old at the home complaining of similar symptoms, said Mabona. “The sibling was also rushed to the clinic, then transferred to Thelle Mogoerane Hospital for urgent medical attention. He is in a critical but stable condition.” Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he was shocked and saddened by the news and he would make an effort to visit the family and school soon. @Zwane_2li2ls The Star
