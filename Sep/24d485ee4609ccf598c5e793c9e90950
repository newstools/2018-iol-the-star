Rhodes University has, for the first time, appointed a harassment and discrimination manager. In response to one of the recommendations made by the sexual violence task team at the university,  Dr Zethu Mkhize has been appointed to this position in the Directorate for Equity and Institutional Transformation. Mkhize started in her new role on September 10 and her responsibilities include transformation, advocacy and awareness-raising in respect to harassment, discrimination, sexual assault and violence. “My role is to provide a safe haven to those who have been wronged and to advise them about options going forward. In such situations, I assess not only what might have happened, but how the person feels and thinks about the situation,” she said. Mkhize has a PhD from the Unisa, where she researched the role of social work in a child-headed household. She did her master’s degree from the University of Zululand where she also lectured for a number of years. Her experience with students grew when she occupied the role of dean of students at the university until 2015. Mkhize feels that Rhodes University’s student population is generally assertive and articulate. “This will greatly help with facilitating the consultative sessions in relation to the refinement of processes.” Mkhize has worked with abused women, orphaned and vulnerable children, grandmothers who are raising their grandchildren, those affected by HIV/Aids, Aids counsellors, people with disabilities and teenagers against drug abuse. “My expertise relates to being responsive to the psychosocial needs of individuals and any challenge that might interfere with their social functioning. Harassment and discrimination are two phenomena that upset a person’s rhythm of life within their living spaces. It is therefore critical that intervention be offered immediately,” said Mkhize.
