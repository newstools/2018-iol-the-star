This was according to the statistic released by Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange on Tuesday. “It is equally important to highlight that we did not perform too well in relation to murder, where the percentage increased by 3.2%, giving us 132 more than the last financial year. From these 2017/2018 murders (4233), 2330 suspects were arrested from 1543 cases, with successful convictions in 726 cases,” De Lange said. She said when “looking at rape cases, from 4171 arrests of 8062 reported cases, we had 896 successful convictions”. “With attempted sexual offences (attempted rape), 314 cases were reported. Arrests were effected in 189 cases, with successful convictions in 43 of those cases. “Of the 1511 reported cases relating to sexual assault, arrests were effected in 729 cases with successful convictions from 116 cases,” De Lange said. Institute for Security Studies senior research consultant Dr Johan Burger said murder, attempted murder, assault and sexual offences “are what we refer to as largely interpersonal crimes”. “This means that these crimes happen mostly between people who know each other and which happen mainly as a result of social and economic conditions. In these cases, there is very little the police can do to prevent them. Police involvement is then largely reactive in relation to investigation, detection and arrest. “Prosecution is the responsibility of the prosecuting authority. Of course, it is a valid argument that police investigations often leave much to be desired and can contribute to low conviction rates,” Burger said. Gender-based violence activists decried the low conviction rates, but in the same breath said this was not surprising. Sonke Gender Justice senior strategist and adviser Bafana Khumalo said many victims of abuse had little faith in the police. At least 108 children were killed in the province, and 549 women were murdered. De Lange said home robberies decreased by 7406 cases. The province recorded the highest number of taxi-related murders in the country with 110 out of 237 killings. @smashaba
