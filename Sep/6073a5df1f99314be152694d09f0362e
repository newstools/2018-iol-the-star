However, the teacher managed to confiscate the firearm and later handed it over to the Eldorado Police for investigation. The Gauteng department of education condemned the act of violence at the sschool popularly known as Blue School and said the School Governing Body would immediately commence with a disciplinary process against the learner. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he wanted cases of school-based violence and other wayward behaviour pf learners to be expedited, accordingly. “We urge all our learners to refrain from acts of misconduct in schools and also call upon the SGB to take decisive action on this matter,” said Lesufi. According to department's spokesperson Steve Mabona, the department has a policy of zero-tolerance to any form of misconduct. "Anyone found to be transgressing this policy will be dealt with in line with South African Schools Act (SASA), which governs all schools. “It is paramount to remind learners that, schools are meant for education and as such they, must always focus on being enriched with knowledge for their successful future endeavours. Ill-discipline will not assist them to achieve any objectives,” said Mabona. The department has offered counselling to all those affected by the incident at the school. The Star
