On the other hand, the Department of Basic Education has revealed that its drive to deliver quality education to the deaf was crippled by a shortage of requisite teachers. A detailed report that DeafSA submitted to the portfolio committee on basic education has raised various concerns about the quality of education deaf learners received. “Deaf and hard of hearing children have the right to a quality education, with the same content and to the same academic level as hearing children,” DeafSA said. “They can and should reach their full potential with appropriate, visual, quality educational programmes and support.” But this was rarely the case, said the report. Learners reported getting education of poor quality. “Many learners and teachers identified a lack of teacher proficiency in South African Sign Language (SASL) as a pivotal problem that not only affects their ability to teach, but also has an impact upon how teachers understand what it is to be deaf,” the report said. Deaf education remained underfunded, said DeafSA. The department had undertaken to approach the National Treasury for increased funding. “However, it is not clear whether this has been done,” DeafSA said. DeafSA blamed underfunding for the shortage of learning and teaching materials. “At a recent training, teachers were given DVDs with videos of poetry in American Sign Language and British Sign Language." Dr Mamiki Maboya, the department's deputy director-general for curriculum policy, support and monitoring, said the shortage of teachers qualified to teach deaf learners was a major problem. Only 30 deaf teachers had graduated from the country's universities over the years. “The sluggish growth in the number of qualified deaf teachers is attributable to low throughput and completion rates for deaf learners and the negligible number who have been entering university,” Maboya said.
