The Mpumalanga lawyer who allegedly went on the run following the stabbing and murder of her businessman husband has been arrested. Mpumalanga police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed to The Star on Tuesday that the woman was arrested on Monday in a location he did not want to disclose. “Yes I can confirm that she was arrested. We are compiling all the relevant information for a media statement. Unfortunately I can’t tell you where she was arrested,” said Hlathi. The Star cannot identify the suspect or her husband as she has not appeared in court. The woman has been missing since the death of her husband on Saturday. It’s believed that the man was stabbed at his home at night while he was in the company of the suspect. The story about his wife being on the run hit social media yesterday triggering a #RIPCaswell. Its believed  the woman fled to Pretoria where her vehicle was found abandoned. Most of the posts carried pictures of the young couple enjoying their time at their lavish home. Some posts show them posing with their flashy cars and their two children. They have been married for just over a year. @lindilesifile
