The cameras - two rear-facing and two front-facing - will be a first for South Africa, and will enable users to take selfies to a new level. “Last year, Huawei introduced the world to AI scene-recognition... with our Huawei Mate 10 Pro,” said Akhram Mohamed, chief technology officer of Huawei Consumer Business Group SA. Mohamed said this meant users were now able to take the best photos possible in a variety of situations - for example of a beach, a sunset or a favourite pet - because the camera was able to identify, in real-time, precisely what it was shooting, and therefore set the best parameters for that scene. Huawei Mate 20 Lite’s has four cameras, two rear-facing and two front-facing and will enable users to take selfies to a new level. “Now, with the Huawei Mate 20 Lite, Huawei is bringing the same kind of intelligent photography to its selfie camera,” he said. The device uses its two AI-powered front-facing cameras to recognise scenery behind the person taking a photo to optimise the image. In addition, Huawei’s new AI and beauty algorithm with facial recognition ensure users are always able to capture the best possible version of themselves. The front-facing cameras also offer AI and 3D Qmoji, which mirror your facial expressions using different characters. - CAJ News
