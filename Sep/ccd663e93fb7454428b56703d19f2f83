In line with its focus on bringing people together and supporting the development of connected communities, the company has selected 116 people. “Many community leaders worldwide and in Africa turn to Facebook to create connections through Facebook groups, WhatsApp or Messenger,” the regional director for Facebook Africa, Nunu Ntshingila, said. “The programme is about empowering them with the tools, support and funding they need to advance their causes and build their communities.” After announcing the programme in February, Facebook received more than 6000 applications from all over the world, and selected leaders with a “strong, clear and committed vision for their community”. Five participants have been selected globally as community leaders in residence and each will be awarded up to R14million to fund their initiatives. Kenya’s Noah Nasiali, the selected leader in residence for Africa, has brought together more than 100000 farmers in Africa through a Facebook group, in less than a year, which helps them obtain and share critical information. “Africa Farmers Club was formed to help farmers come together to access credible, reliable and applicable farming information that will help them develop their skills, get a market for their produce and get returns for their hard work,” Nasiali said. “Our community aims to contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goal which is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.” The Facebook programme will also host more than 100 fellows and youth participants who will receive up to $50000 (R700000) each to be used for their community initiative.- African News Agency (ANA)
