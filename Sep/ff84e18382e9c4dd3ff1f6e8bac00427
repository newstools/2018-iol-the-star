Johannesburg - "I didn't f**k you hard enough on tour." These were the chilling words former hostel master Collan Rex allegedly uttered to a 15-year-old Parktown Boys High School learner moments before he supposedly dry-humped the minor. These gruesome details emerged on Tuesday morning at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court in Ekurhuleni, where Rex is facing 183 charges ranging from attempted murder, rape, sexual grooming and exposing minors to pornography. The learner, who is now 17 years old and has since left Parktown Boys, testified that Rex had invited him into his room when the then 15-year-old's mother couldn't fetch him after he had returned from a water polo trip in Durban. Rex, who was also the boy's water polo coach and hostel master, allegedly invited the learner into his room to supposedly play the video game X-Box and they both sat on the accused's bed. "He looked at me and said: 'I didn't f**k you hard enough on tour.' He then lifted my legs in the air and started dry humping me," the emotional teenager said. The boy said he was on his back on top of Rex's bed at the time, where the accused was standing in the edge. Asked by State prosecutor Advocate Arveena Persad what dry humping entailed, the teenager said: "He (Rex) would do a pelvic thrust against my bum. When I started fighting back, he stopped." However,Â  defence Advocate William Robertse emphasised that his client would testify that the alleged dry humping never occurred. "He (Rex) admits that he was in a room with you playing X-Box, and that's all that happened," Robertse asserted. Rex has already pleaded guilty to 144 counts of sexual assault, but has pleaded not guilty to the remaining 183. There are 23 complainants in this case who were aged between 13 and 16 when the alleged crimes were committed. The trial continues. @khayakoko88 The Star
