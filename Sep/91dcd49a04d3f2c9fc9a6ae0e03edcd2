 Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease that impairs memory and other mental functions. It is the most common form of dementia that generalises memory loss and loss of other essential cognitive abilities that are serious enough to interfere with an individual’s daily life. The year marks the seventh world Alzheimer’s month since the campaign was launched in 2012. From previous studies, an average of two out of three people globally have little or no understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and associated dementia in their countries. Since its inception, the impact of World Alzheimer’s Month is increasing. However, the stigmatisation and lack of information surrounding dementia remains a global problem that calls for global action. Most people often think that this disease is a normal part of ageing. Though this may not be true, the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease is increasing age. This is evident by majority of Alzheimer’s patients being 65 years or older. This doesn’t completely classify the disease as a disease of the elderly. There are about 200000 Americans under the age of 65 who are suffering from disease. For this year’s event, organisations and interested individuals can get involved by supporting awareness through contacting the Alzheimer’s association in their specific country. Alzheimer’s South Africa NPC provides a wide range of specialist services for people with dementia and their carers. See: https://alzheimers.org.za.
