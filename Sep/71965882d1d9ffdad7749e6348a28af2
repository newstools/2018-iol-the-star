“We all need to rise up to this challenge in whatever way we can to be the voice of our endangered species. Their conservation is our sole responsibility, I believe." Vilane's list of achievements includes reaching the summit of Mount Everest twice, reaching the top of all seven of the world's highest peaks and walking to the South Pole unassisted. The upcoming Rhino Peak Challenge on September 22 at the iconic Rhino Peak in the southern region of the Maloti Drakensberg World Heritage Site, will pale in significance to his previous feats. Organisers said the intervention of Endangered Wildlife Trust chief executive Yolan Friedman allowed Vilane to be confirmed for this year. As an ex-game ranger, Vilane has been at the forefront of conservation in South Africa. “I cannot stand and watch from the sideline while the rhino is being wiped off the planet," he said.
