The Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) has been tasked with constructing a heritage walkway, which runs along Houghton Drive and is almost near completion. The significance of this project rests in the historical value of the stone wall bus shelter and chlorination chamber, which is assumed to have been built in 1939. The JDA said the construction of the Rea Vaya along this corridor necessitated the construction of a pedestrian bridge parallel to the historical stone retaining wall, hence the inception of the Heritage Walkway project. The historical stone wall lays the backdrop to the pedestrian walkway, which involves road widening and paving works. “It was important to ensure that the roll-out of Rea Vaya infrastructure along this corridor did not have a negative impact on the heritage value of existing heritage structures. “The project is well on its way to completion. Ensuring that these historical structures remain un-damaged and their heritage integrity uncompromised was a key component of the construction,” said Christo Botes, JDA’s chief executive. “The heritage walkway will improve walkability and safety for pedestrians in the area and add heritage value,” he said.
