Backlash from social media users is the reason the family of fitness fanatic Sbahle Mpisane removed a video of hers that was recently taken in hospital and posted on social media. The family confirmed this on Wednesday, saying “malicious attacks” caused them to remove the video of Mpisane thanking fans and her family for the support as she recovers in hospital from a horrific car crash. The video showed the “glammed up” personality surrounded by flowers and “get well soon” balloons. She's seated on the hospital  bed, heavily made up with a very long wig on, her right hand is bandaged and her brother Andile is standing next to her. Andile posted the video on Instagram as Mpisane thanks fans and her family for the support they gave her after her accident in Durban last month. Mpisane has been in hospital since she had a head-on collision during the earlier hours of Women’s Day. Jaws of Life had to be used to remove her from her mangled BMW after colliding with a tree. The video caused a stir on social media with Twitter trolls questioning Mpisane’s appearance and welfare. The comments caused the family to remove the video after what they said were “malicious attacks” against Andile, Mpisane and the family. Sharing another video, Andile wrote: “Kindly note I’ve taken down my sister @sbahle_mpisane recovery video on my page, after some malicious attacks towards me, my sister and family.” Andile said he shared the video to update the public of Mpisane’s progress and her recovery. “After the tragic accident she had people were gossiping all negative rumours on social media, newspapers about her which pains me dearly and my family,” he wrote. “Thanks very much for the continuous support and prayers and note that my sister Sbahle appreciates each and everyone of you. Siyabonga.” @Chulu_M The Star
