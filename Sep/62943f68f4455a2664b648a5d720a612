A firefighter died after allegedly slipping out the window of the building that houses the departments of Health and Settlement in the Joburg CBD. Sipho Senabe of Gauteng Health confirmed that the fire broke out on the 23rd floor of the building. He said two female employees were stuck in the building when the fire intensified. Senabe, however, said the evacuation process was successful and the women have been taken to hospital. The firefighter was responding to the blaze at the building when he fell to his death. As he lay on the ground, the gold foil he had been covered with  kept blowing away. Next to his body was his helmet and oxygen tank. People are alleged to have heard a scream followed by a huge thud as the man hit the ground.  Other traumatised people said when his body hit the ground, it sounded like a gunshot.      Employees who were still in shock say they were in disbelief when they heard the building was on fire and they didn’t want to move. Spokesperson for the Johannesburg Emergency Services Nana Radebe was unable to confirm if it was indeed a fire fighter that had died. The Star
