The participants undertook the so-called “Happiest 5k Walk on the Planet” to welcome spring. The walk included those living with physical disabilities. The colour stations were an explosion of colour with powder being flung in participants’ faces, white T-shirts and hair. Many walked out of the school’s premises with powder everywhere.      The Color Run is the world’s largest running series. It was started in 2011, with the aim of bringing people together to make the world a happier and healthier place. Yanga Mbedu attended the run for the first time and said she had been wanting to participate for a long time. “We decided to come and experience what it's about, and it’s a Color Run so we wanted to have fun, make memories and be a part of it,” she said. “We want to be colourful because it’s spring.”      Khomotso Molokwane participated in the run last year and wanted to experience the fun again. “I’m a person who gyms, and the Color Run keeps the family together and brings us together,” she said. Mtho Lushozi attended the event for the first time this year and promised to come back again. “I’ve never been this dirty - it’s like I’m a child again, but it was amazing,” he said. “I loved it and I’ll do it again next year.”      The whole event came together in a colour blast at the end. The runners danced and jumped in front of the main stage, where they threw powder into the air and all over each other. The colour blast created a massive multicoloured cloud of powder. The next Color Run will be held in Sea Point, Cape Town, on November 10 so that Capetonians can also join in the fun. @Chulu_M
