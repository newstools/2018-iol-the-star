Bright Okpocha, better known by his stage name Basketmouth, from Nigeria, came out tops as he won the Savanna Pan-African Comic of the Year Award for the second time in a row. Basketmouth, who was competing against great acts such as Uganda's Anne Kansiime, Carl Joshua Ncube from Zimbabwe, Salvado from Uganda and Charles Manase from Botswana, was humbled by his win again this year on Saturday at Gold Reef City's Lyric Theatre. Prior to taking home the trophy, he said: “I am a bit anxious and nervous - the Comics Choice Awards has that feeling.” South Africa's most popular funny guy was Carvin Goldstone - walking away with two trophies, beating the likes of Celeste Ntuli, Skhumba Hlophe, Mpho Modikoane and Alfred Adriaan. Comedian David Kau received the Comedy G Award. A surprise at the awards was the lack of gender representation, as no female comedian won this year. This year's awards show, at the Lyric Theatre at Gold Reef City, was directed by Jefferson “J Bobs” Tshabalala and co-written by comedians Lazola Gola, Gilli Apter, Camilo Saloojee and Mo Mothebe. About 1200 guests at the theatre were tickled with a combination of musical acts, from the legendary Johnny Clegg and recipient of the prestigious Lifetime Achiever Award, Pieter-Dirk Uys. The Lifetime Achiever Award was presented to him by Clegg, who brought the house down with a surprise performance of Asimbonanga. Uys, who is the person behind the most famous white woman in South Africa, Evita Bezuidenhout, was honoured by a friend who respected his craft and courage to go past the norm. Clegg said: “Pieter-Dirk Uys was able to say things that if he had said them as Pieter-Dirk Uys he would have been arrested and put in jail. It was a clever way, in a very difficult time, at the height of the Struggle, where we had people being banned and censored he managed to get (his views) through". @Zwane_2li2ls The Star
