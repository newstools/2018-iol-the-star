This was the shocking revelation made by Denath when he testified at the Nugent commission, tasked with investigating tax administration and governance at Sars since the appointment of suspended head Tom Moyane in September 2014. Denath told the commission that he was one of the officials placed on suspension for their roles in blocking the flow of counterfeit cigarettes and alcohol through the borders of South Africa. According to him, several serious allegations were made against three Sars staff members, including that they allegedly created fertile business operations for big tobacco industry players such as British American Tobacco. Denath said since the allegations had surfaced, Sars had flouted processes of instituting investigations and rejected all his representations to them to demonstrate his innocence. Denath said Sars spent R3m to kick him out of his job, but the CCMA ruled in his favour in July this year. The commission continues. Political Bureau
