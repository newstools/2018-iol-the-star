Johnson made a brief appearance in the South Gauteng High Court on Tuesday. The court heard that sentencing proceedings in the case had to be postponed to the end of next week as the pre-sentence report was not ready. Prosecutor Andre Maharaj told court it would be ready next week. The report was necessary for arguments on aggravating and mitigating factors. Johnson faced a life sentence for kidnapping, raping and murdering 10-year-old Chrisainya June Nikita Carelse last year. An indictment sheet from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said Carelse was discovered half naked, “lying on her back with a large cement block on her chest”. The post-mortem concluded the child was raped before she was killed, said the NPA’s document. “The deceased had sustained stab wounds to her neck and vagina.” She had also been bludgeoned with a blunt object. Johnson, who was 18-years-old at the time, kidnapped Carelse from her grandmother’s shack. The grandmother was intoxicated after drinking alcohol with Johnson at his house. He accompanied the grandmother back to her shack just before 1am. Carelse, who was well-known to her killer, was found dead in an open veld the next morning. Johnson was arrested three days after the gruesome finding. He was released due to a lack of evidence. But, thanks to DNA tests conducted at the SAPS Forensic Science Laboratory, he was re-arrested and charged four months later. Johnson’s blood matched the blood found on the girl’s shirt, said the NPA’s indictment. Carelse’s killer was returned to prison after his brief appearance on Tuesday.
