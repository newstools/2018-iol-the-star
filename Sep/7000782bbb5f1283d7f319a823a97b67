The youth was apparently upset because the teacher stopped him from jumping the food queue at school and wanted to discipline him. The learner returned to school the next day. He was armed with a knife and stabbed the teacher to death in front of the rest of the children. The trauma to the other children in the school and the teacherâ€™s family is unimaginable. Children on drugs and who have violent tendencies or a history of violent behaviour have no place in mainstream schools because they disrupt learning and instill fear in all those around them. They should be placed in institutions where they can be watched and contained until they demonstrate signs of wanting to change and become respectable. The Education Department needs to revisit this problem and come up with proper policies rather than to just shrug its shoulders in despair and pass the buck on to families. These children respect no one. Their families live in constant fear of them, especially when they become manically violent under the influence of drugs like amphetamine (tik), cannabis and alcohol. Expecting desperate families to restrain the delinquent children is crass and displays an ignorance about how difficult it is to deal with violent children on drugs. The death of this young teacher is a tragedy. It is a tragedy because this loss of life could have been avoided if we had a proper policy in place. Society and families need to be protected from the toxic and sometimes lethal influence of such children. These children should be kept in places/homes where the underlying causes can be addressed by professionals trained in the field. Throwing these children into prison or on to the streets is certainly not the solution. Our teachers and learners need to feel safe in their schools if proper learning is to take place.
