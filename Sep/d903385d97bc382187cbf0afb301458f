The party said on Monday that the media reports would not affect his role as chairperson of portfolio committees, including the one for justice and correctional services which he was elected to last week. ANC caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli said chief whip Jackson Mthembu has noted the report, and the allegations contained in it. “The chief whip will meet with comrade Smith to get to the bottom of the matter,” Mhlauli said. On Sunday, City Press said that Smith was paid R670 000 by facilities management group Bosasa over the past three years. The paper also reported that Smith allegedly accepted the installation of electric fences and a high-end CCTV system at his home, worth about R200 000, and allegedly also received R100 000 from Bosasa chief executive officer Gavin Watson monthly. Smith was quoted confirming some of the payments, claiming that they were personal loans, but he denied receiving monthly cash payments. The DA has since threatened to report Smith to the ethics committee. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said the allegations had the potential to further undermine Parliament. “If found guilty of unethical conduct, Smith would be unfit to chair any portfolio committee,” he said. Ethics committee co-chairperson Omie Singh would not comment on what action they would take until an official complaint was made. Political Bureau
