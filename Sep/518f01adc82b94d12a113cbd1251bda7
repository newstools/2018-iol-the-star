Stacey has had three books published by the tender age of 11, and became Africa’s youngest published author at the age of 7. The young writer stood and spoke animatedly before a rapt, wide-eyed audience of foundation phase learners and teachers as she read from her first book, Smelly Cats. It was a particularly special moment for the Crown Mines School community, which got a library - housed in a shipping container - in February 2015 through the Mandela Library Project. The library project works with under-resourced schools to establish and maintain container libraries in order to boost literacy. Robert Coutts, chief executive of the Mandela Education Project, under which the library project falls, said: “Stacey is an example of the power of education and, specifically, literacy. To be able to understand and portray real-life struggles as she did with her Smelly Cats story at just 7 years old shows how life-changing education, particularly at the foundation phase, is. It’s the truest example of Nelson Mandela’s famous quote that ‘education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world’.” The project has seen marked success, with a recent report detailing how pupils significantly improved in their reading ability at schools where the library programme has been in force. Since 2011, the Mandela Library Project has seen the delivery of more than 100 libraries. Each library typically services 1000 children a year and remains active for at least 15 years. The libraries are managed on a daily basis by education and social justice NGO SoulBuddyz. The Star
