Member of the mayoral committee for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba appealed to residents to refrain from lighting fires in non-designated spaces in parks, disposing of charcoal on the lawns or against trees, consuming alcohol, playing loud music or littering in the parks. “The Heritage Day weekend sees hundreds of people converge on parks - it is wonderful to see families and friends enjoying the city’s public open spaces, but the high number of complaints regarding litter, illegal fires and drinking alcoholic beverages in parks is worrying,” she said. The parks department would have its litter-picking services in place throughout the long weekend, but residents had a responsibility to ensure that the parks and other facilities were properly used and protected, to ensure the enjoyment of all the residents and to safeguard the city’s heritage, added Sifumba. The Joburg Metropolitan Police Department will be patrolling parks together with park rangers and will confiscate alcohol illegally consumed in the City’s parks. Residents are urged to obey all park safety by-laws and to report transgressions to the Joburg emergency call centre on 011 375 5911.
