The Sassa pay cycle for September has started and Mark Barnes, South African Post Office CEO engaged with beneficiaries at the Post Office branch in Jabulani Mall, Soweto. His presence did not change much as beneficiaries were unhappy with the service and lack of special treatment for pensioners. Nomsa Mhlophe, who was there to collect her mother's old age grant and a child-support grant told The Star on Monday that the only challenge with collecting there money was the fact that the elderly were left outside to stand in a long queue under the sun. “Most of them (pensioners) take medication, it's been long that you find them standing in the queues," she said. Mhlophe suggested that the Post Office open a little earlier. “They should put more machines and make an effort to make sure that things work faster, especially for older people." Mhlophe added that beneficiaries were told that the first time they withdraw should be at the Post Office and from there they would be able to use various merchants. Barnes said it was unfortunate that there were long queues and that he was working hard to make sure that there were new systems or computers put into place. “Just coming in here, I’ve found that some of the machines are down. I've been on the phone in the back trying to organise new computers and laptops, so that we can deal with the long queues and make sure that we deliver on our mandate, which is to pay social grants,” said Barnes. “Systems break down from time to time and sometimes wherever you go you will find that there are system glitches. My job is to make it work,” he added. @Zwane_2li2ls
