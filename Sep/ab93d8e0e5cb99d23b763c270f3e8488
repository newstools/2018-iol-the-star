A prison warder has been arrested and charged with defeating the ends of justice, perjury and corruption for allegedly helping a prisoner escape from police custody. Mxolisi Booi is serving  a 10 year imprisonment at the Boksburg Correctional Service for armed robbery. However, last week Wednesday he escaped from Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital by disarming the warder. Booi had allegedly colluded with the warder to assist with his escape from the hospital and provide him with a firearm by paying him R4000. They allegedly had an agreement that Booi would go home for a few days and return the firearm. Gauteng SAPS spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said a tactical response team including SAPS, Correctional Service and Ekurhuleni Metro Police received information about Booi and the Mercedes Benz he was using. The red vehicle had been spotted on the  N12 but sped off from the police. “During an ensuing chase, several shots were fired until the vehicle stopped,” said Dlamini. Booi was allegedly in the vehicle with his wife and both of them were arrested. He is alleged to have taken  the teams to where he had hidden the firearm that he had taken from the warder during his escape. Dlamini said the team recovered the warder’s firearm, 32 rounds of ammunition,  leg irons and prisoner’s uniform. Booi will face a further charge of possession of an unlicensed firearm. Booi and the warder were  both due to appear at the  Johannesburg Magistrate Court on Thursday. @Chulu_M
