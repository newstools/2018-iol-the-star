Johannesburg - Power FM talk show host Onkgopotse JJ Tabane has confirmed that he had been suspended but had not received the suspension in writing. Tabane was suspended from the radio station on Tuesday after apologising to acting GCIS head Phumla Williams on his show last week.Tabane had apologised to Williams for turning a blind eye to the difficulties she faced under former Communications minister Faith Muthambi. The host, who was off air from last Thursday, confirmed the suspension. “I was told I was suspended following the apology I gave to Pumla Williams on my show last week,” said Tabane. “They need to think about what it means for the business.” Tabane said he did not know how long he would be off air but was told by management that his matter would be assessed at the end of the week. Power FM marketing manager Masego Serape was reached for comment and repeatedly promised to respond to questions, but never did. Tabane said he would wait for management to make a decision. The host, who also has a column in The Star called Let’s Talk Frankly, will write his last column on Monday. Last week, Tabane indicated to The Star editor Japhet Ncube that he would like to take a break from writing to complete his PhD. “We are sad to see him go because he has a huge following among our readers. His political columns got the nation talking. He was one of our best columnists. But we also value education and wish him well in his studies,” said Ncube. Last Tuesday, Tabane said on his show that he was willing to defend Williams’ testimony during the ongoing state capture commission of inquiry. Williams had earlier that day told the inquiry of how Muthambi emotionally tortured her while she was heading up GCIS. @Chulu_M The Star
