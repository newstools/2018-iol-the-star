The City of Joburg will fly flags at half-mast in municipal buildings as a sign of respect for the three firefighters who lost their lives last week. Five firefighters were trapped on the 23rd floor where the fire started. One plunged to his death, one was burnt and the other died of smoke inhalation. The dead firefighters are Simphiwe Moropane, 28; Khathutshelo Muedi, 37 and Mduduzi Ndlovu, 40. Speaker of the Johannesburg Council, Vasco da Gama, said: “We will remember this period when the city not only lost three firefighters, but also three fathers, husbands and colleagues. “These men, as well as all the men and women in our emergency management services, leave their homes daily not knowing whether they will return safely. “They risk their lives on a daily basis to ensure that we are safe as the citizens of Joburg,” Da Gama said. “We thank you for your selfless service and dedication to the City of Johannesburg emergency management services department.” The flags will be half-masted for the mourning period before the burial ceremonies.
