Our leaders need to stop telling half-truths and twisting the facts. They need to respect themselves and South Africans. We need to have a proper system of accounting for the countryâ€™s money in place, where information is available at the touch of a button. We cannot continue to manage in ignorance. We need to move expeditiously to have more data-sharing and harvesting so that we can make informed decisions. Many South Africans voted for the ANC a few years ago because they wanted a change; they wanted honesty; they wanted transparency. Instead they have been fed lie after lie after lie. The ANC has lost the moral authority to govern the people of this beautiful land. And it has let down all those who voted for it. It has also let down honest members of its own party. Times are tough, but all hope is not lost. The greatness of the South African people is on display every day in the arena of sport, education, culture and many others. What we need is our leaders to lift their outdated standard of governance to match the greatness of the South African people.
