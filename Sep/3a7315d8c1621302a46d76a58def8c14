This year’s polo chic was out in full force as local celebrities sported cool tones and light fabrics. Polo lover Lalla Hirayama donned a multi-layered peplum dress, letting her hair loose to enhance the already stunning look. She said she had had the dress for a while and decided to bring it out for the luxurious event. Various marquees, such as the Allure Grey Goose and the Equus marquees, hosted local and international celebrities who were there to watch South Africa face off against Australia.  Although the match was not in South Africa’s favour, media personalities brought heat to the fashion scoreboard. From Gert Johann Coetzee looking stylish in shades of blue to Mthokozisi "Dash" Mkhathini making a bold statement in a tangerine suit, this year’s fashion was intricate, intriguing and enticing. Others on the green carpet were best friends and actresses Terry Pheto and Mampho Brescia, dressed by That’s It boutique. Pheto said: “Right now we are celebrating, as many may not know my BFF (best friend forever) has been signed as the ambassador for Brand Japan and she will be jetting off in a couple of days. So it’s all exciting because big things are coming.” Brescia said “the future is looking super bright, just like this day”. Luxury lounge Allure saw celebrities dressed to the nines in shades of blue and white.  The likes of Boity Thuli, Kefilwe Mabote, Dineo Moeketsi and David Kau dressed up for the occasion. The Heineken marquee hosted the likes of Khanya Mkangisa and K Naomi. Designers, including David Tlale and Orapeleng Modutle, also graced the day with their presence as several celebrities wore their creations. @Zwane_2li2ls
