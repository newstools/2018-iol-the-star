With sex pest Collan Rex’s sentencing proceedings expected to begin today, the judge in the matter has a history of handing down harsh sentences in high-profile cases. South Gauteng High Court Judge Peet Johnson, who convicted Rex on 144 counts of sexual assault and 12 of assault on Friday, was the presiding officer who labelled flamboyant foreign exchange trader Sandile Mantsoe as “the devil in disguise” when he gave the murderer an effective 32 years' imprisonment four months ago. Mantsoe was convicted of assaulting, killing and discarding the charred body of his then 22-year-old Soweto model girlfriend Karabo Mokoena in Sandton. This comes as Phindi Mjonondwane, Gauteng spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority, told The Star that the State would be seeking the “harshest possible sentence” for the paedophile Rex. Advocate William Robertse, Rex’s lawyer, promised to give The Star comment on what they feel a fair sentencing would be, but did not answer repeated calls or messages on Sunday. Robert McBride, who is the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), was called “an evil person” by Judge Johnson in 2011 following his guilty verdict for his drunk driving charge.
