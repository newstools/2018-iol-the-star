With the International Day of Peace having been marked on Friday, NPO Kidz2Kidz is looking to weed out bullying. The organisation is launching its year-long anti-bullying programme called Cool2BeKind, which aims to educate and create awareness around bullying and provide resources for victims of bullying. “We are passionate about unwrapping the truths to bullying. Through education, we hope to take teachers, children and schools on the journey of becoming anti- bullying ambassadors,” said founder and national co-ordinator of Kidz2Kidz Dee Boehner. “We teach parents and educators how to identify the signs, and what to do if it takes place.” Boehner said the programme was aimed at educating and creating awareness around bullying and supporting victims of bullying. The programme also supports other anti-bullying initiatives, such as primary school pupil Lelo Mofokeng’s self-published book on how he survived bullying in Grade 1. Cool2BeKind Gauteng co-ordinator Sam Heald said Mofokeng’s book, I Survived Bullying, explored truths of bullying in a way that children and adults alike could understand. Mofokeng’s mother, Leeyah Lerato Rakgaba, said: “We, as parents or guardians, need to listen more to our children and make it our duty to know what’s going on in their lives.” Heald said it was important to note that the bully was often also a victim who came from a background where there was insecurity, abuse, little parent involvement, and inconsistency in the actions of parents. Some signs Heald said might point to a bullying problem include unexplainable injuries; lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewellery; frequent headaches or stomach aches.
