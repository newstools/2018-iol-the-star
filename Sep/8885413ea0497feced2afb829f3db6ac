September is Albinism Awareness Month, during which non-governmental organisations work to dispel the misconceptions and myths, especially in Africa, surrounding albinism. In Africa, people with albinism live in fear of being killed for their body parts, which are used as muti. There is a lucrative black market for these body parts. Climb For Albinism began as a dream in 2016 and is is becoming a reality for the six women from various backgrounds and different African countries. Their climb to the summit of Kilimanjaro will be used “to demonstrate the ability of women with albinism to be role-models”. Award-winning film-maker Elia Saikaly, who will be leading the team up the mountain, said: “The highest point in Africa is the platform we will use to shine a spotlight on this rare genetic disorder, the challenges people with albinism face, and their strength and courage to overcome those challenges. "This expedition will demonstrate the ability of women with albinism to lead, shine and be role-models to members of their own community and around the world.” Saikaly said the stories of each participant would be posted on social media; would appear in other media, prior to and during the climb; and would be told in a documentary which would be screened at various film festivals. South African singer, actress and dancer Regina Ndlovu, Kenyan advocate Jane Waithera, Zimbabwean education consultant and brand strategist Nodumo Ncomanzi, Senegalese musician and co-founder of the Care Albinos Association, Maah Keita, Nigerian optometrist and entrepreneur Edi Onyinye and Tanzanian activist and entrepreneur Mariam Staford - whose arms were hacked off with a machete on her family farm while she was with her son - form the team. These women have faced various challenges, some horrific, but are now stronger than before.
