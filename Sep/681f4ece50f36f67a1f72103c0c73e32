I have tried to follow up on the matter but I seem to be passed around to different people. Initially the JRA informed me that, as far as they were concerned, the problem was fixed. I informed them this was not the case. They then gave me another reference number and told me to contact the Norwood branch. I tried to make an appointment to meet, to no avail - I later received a phone call informing me that, as far as their records show, the problem was fixed. This is now over three months ago. Rochford writes again: You will be pleased to hear that the problem has been resolved (September 10). Thank you for your assistance in the matter.
