Two priests have started a project to help those affected by the Life Esidimeni tragedy pick up the pieces and rebuild their lives. Methodist Church pastors Andrew Pietersen and Joseph Maboe were also severely affected by the deaths of at least 144 Esidimeni patients. Pietersen’s uncle Victor survived the tragedy while Maboe’s son Billy died at an unlicensed and ill-equipped psychiatric institution where he was sent. The two clerics have partnered to raise an awareness and promote care for psychiatric patients using the word of God. Pietersen said that the tragedy revealed that some of the patients had no one to care for them. “(We need) to give prayer and life skills support to involuntary and assisted mental health care users and their families or loved ones,” said Pietersen. “This will lead to dignity, respect and improved health and active community involvement in the support of people with mental illness or disability.” He added that it was vital for Christians to lend a helping hand and reach out to people living with such conditions and their loved ones. “People with mental disability or illness are also created in God’s image. “Show them love, care and respect,” he implored. Pietersen also said they want to support patients and the families of the survivors of the tragedy with advice on how best to use the money that they were awarded at the Life Esidimeni arbitration. The initiative would work together with the SA Depression and Anxiety Group, SA Federation for Mental Health and SA Society of Psychiatrists. @thaboroe  The Sunday Independent
