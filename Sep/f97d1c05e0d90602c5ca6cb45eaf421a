The Hisense Infinity H11, which is powered by Android, makes the choice easy if you are looking for an affordable and compatible device. I am crazy about gadgets and am always looking for something that can fit my lifestyle and meet my budget. I was thrilled to get an Infinity H11 to review and quickly began to put the device to the test. The camera is great for both videos and photos. Its beauty feature impressively provided just enough airbrush to make anyone look beautiful. My family and friends loved it. The option to add a voice note to an image is also great, along with the photo editing feature. Professional editing allows you to adjust your settings in accordance with your preferences giving you the best image. The phone comes with internal storage of 32GB, providing an abundance of capacity for contacts, photos, videos and recordings. The H11’s sound is top class and with its recording capability, I was able to record hours of interviews in a noisy space and refer back to them without any hassles. Another feature that stood out was the built-in FM radio. The H11 will make the avid radio listener happy with this facility. The phone has an easy Mobile Managing app which allows the user to keep track of the device’s storage capacity and gives a breakdown of apps that consume most of the storage. As an Android phone, the H11 is compatible with popular social media apps such as Twitter, Facebook, and Gmail. The battery life is decent as the phone can go for hours without the need to recharge. The H11 comes with an impressive security system. The device has a few fingerprint-related functions for, among others, answering calls, taking photos and alarm activation. The H11 is for both the young and the old. @ZintleMahlati
