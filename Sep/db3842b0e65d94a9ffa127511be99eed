“Don’t believe everything you read on social media." This was a strong warning from Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi in reference to allegations that have been abound that foreign spaza shop owners were selling fake and expired goods. That resulted widespread looting and violence that led to at least four people being killed and others injured. Motsoaledi said despite the violence in Soweto last week, his department has not been given any evidence of the existence of these fake foods. “I’ve been told there’s rice made of plastic and bread that doesn’t dissolve in water.  I have seen all these pictures but when I ask for evidence, I have not received it. “Bring the foodstuff to us. If you buy it, we will reimburse you. We have scientists here waiting in anticipation,” Motsoaledi said. He said there seems to also be a confusion over expiry dates on foodstuffs. The health minister said the ‘best before date’ on foodstuff was not an expiry date. "People confuse that. It’s used for quality and stock rotation. These are long shelf life foods which are mostly dry and tinned.”  The ‘use-by date’ is an expiry date. It means when the food is consumed it becomes unpalatable. We strongly believe once the expiry date is passed, people must respect it.” Motsoaledi said people should be careful about believing everything they read online. "Social media is out of control. Any warning about foodstuffs is false. If I want to say something, I’ll call a press conference," he said.
