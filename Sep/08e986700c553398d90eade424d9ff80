With spring upon us, the City of Ekurhuleni warns that snake season starts and many of these reptiles will emerge after a long period of hibernation - hungry and in search of food. The city’s senior environmentalist, Christopher Mthombeni, also a snake catcher, cautioned pet owners to be on high alert and keep an eye on their domestic pets as they just may fall prey to snakes. Should residents come across a snake in their living space, Mthombeni says people should not panic. He said they must keep the snake within vision at a distance of about five metres, not try to kill or handle it, and to give it right of way. “Don’t block its way and, from a distance, look at where the snake ends up while you call for help. “Remember snakes do not have ears so they can’t hear you, but they pick up vibrations and movements, so avoid moving a lot,” said Mthombeni. The Ekurhuleni region is prone to snakes because of the Blesbokspruit river system, Bullfrog Pan and other Highveld grasslands with good eco-systems for snakes. Mthombeni warned residents to be aware of puff adders and rinkhals, as they are extremely dangerous with the puff adder known to be very instinctive, slow in pace and quick to sense danger. The rinkhals, or ring-necked cobra, is a fast-mover that is good at faking death. It is easily identified by the two white stripes across its throat. Mthombeni said that not all snakes are poisonous; however, all snake bites should be treated seriously and be checked by a medical doctor. Residents should use their municipal bins to dispose of refuse as this may attract rodents and snakes.
