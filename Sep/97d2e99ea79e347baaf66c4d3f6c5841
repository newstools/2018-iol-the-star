Johannesburg - It could be over a month before Collan Rex learns his fate as delays in the conclusion of his pre-sentencing report stalled sentencing proceedings. On Thursday at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court, prosecutor Advocate Arveena Persad said the report, which includes victim impact statements conducted by social workers, were still not complete. Persad added that more probation officers, who are responsible for conducting the report, might be hired in order to conclude the necessary document. Rex, a former water polo coach and hostel master at Parktown Boys High School, was convicted earlier this month on 156 counts of large-scale sexual and physical assault on over a dozen learners aged between 13 and 16 between 2015 and 2016. The former coach's sordid acts include grabbing, squeezing and rubbing his penis against those of learners in a lewd act known as dry humping. Advocate Persad said the report was expected to be finalised by October 31, but that the State needed to inform the Judge President for the date to be officially confirmed. The State had yet to notify the Judge President, Persad added, and the October date was expected to be settled on Friday. Rex is still out on bail and will appear in court on Friday. The Star
