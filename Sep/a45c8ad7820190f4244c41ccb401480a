However, budgets are limited due to the reprioritising of the city’s capital expenditure. Vuyisile Mshudulu, the director of arts, culture and heritage, said the city was the custodian of some of the most important heritage assets in the country, including the Johannesburg Art Gallery, Museum Africa and the Workers Museum. The city, he said, had also invested in the creation and management of museums in Soweto, such as the Hector Pieterson Museum, the Kliptown Museum and the June16 Interpretation Centre. “These institutions provide city residents and tourists with access to our rich heritage and historical collections,” he said. Mshudulu said the Johannesburg Art Gallery building remained in need of much attention. “This is due, largely, to years of neglect, a lack of proper maintenance, defective workmanship from service providers, and long-standing structural weaknesses affecting the newer parts of the building.” In response to these challenges, professional studies were commissioned in 2017/18 to guide a process of restoration over the next few years. “The next step is to develop a detailed scheme of work to fully restore the building. Initial estimates are approximately R60million.” Mshudulu said some seed capital expenditure had been budgeted for the restoration of the art gallery, the Workers Museum and Museum Africa. “However, the funding has been reprioritised to more pressing capital expenditure priorities. The city is, however, committed to relooking at providing funding for these important cultural institutions to ensure that their restoration is resourced.” He said the city was appealing to the private sector to help find the resources needed to bring the art gallery back to its former glory.
