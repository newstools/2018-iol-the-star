A heritage blue plaque was unveiled by City of Joburg MMC for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba and the Johannesburg Heritage Foundation at the legend's Orlando East home in Soweto on Monday. Later a tribute concert was held at the nearby Orlando Community Hall. Mbulu has travelled the world entertaining people of many nations with hit after hit. Her talents have afforded her the opportunity to work with the likes of King of Pop Michael Jackson. As part of the Arts Alive International Festival, the city honoured her through performances by friends from the music industry, together with rising young talents. The tribute is in line with Diphetogo, the city's programmes to honour its legends while they are still alive. “I thank God for the gift He gave me, and my mother who nurtured it. I'm also indebted to James Mabena, the man who discovered me. It is the people of this country who made me aware that I had something special, because every time I performed they applauded, approved and gave me the confidence. The Americans just put on a stamp,” said Mbulu, who started performing in Soweto at the age of 13.
