About 50 Red Ants from the private security company were deployed to escort Pikitup workers into their building on Tuesday morning. This follows a series of protests after some employees from the Jozi@work contract who started in 2015 were hired on a permanent contract while others were not absorbed. "Our first contract started in 2008 and ended 2011. After that we have been jobless but they hired new people from the new in sourced company. Eighty-two of us are now unemployed," said a woman who declined to be named. She alleged that the new workers either bribed management or gave sexual favors to get hired. The whole of Village street was closed of because of the commotion and police presence was high. They also threw two grenade to stop the angry crowd from attacking the manager and workers. On-going violent protests in some Pikitup depots in Gauteng left waste management employees not reporting for work, fearing for their lives. On Tuesday morning, another Pikitup truck was stoned and damaged in Westbury. That prompted Pikitup Spokesperson Muzi Mkhwanazi to declare that the situation was getting out of hand as trucks were getting damaged.The attacks have been so bad that the company withdrew their services from Soweto as the workers were constantly attacked and their vehicles damaged. “We are faced with a situation were people have been demanding jobs. They have been going to our depots and blocking operations,” he said. “We have been working with the South African Police Services and the Johannesburg Metro Police Department in our depots. The lives of our staff are under threat. The situation has led to an increase of illegal dumping. We have suspended services until it is safe,” Mkhwanazi said.
