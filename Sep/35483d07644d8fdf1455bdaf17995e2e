Johannesburg - The bail application of a lawyer who allegedly murdered her socialite husband has been postponed after her lawyer gave her proof of residence to a wrong investigating officer. Itumeleng Eunice Maseko,26, walked up the stairs of the eMalahleni Magistrates Court wrapped in a blue blanket while spotting a weave and manicured fingernails as she took the stand ahead of the hearing on Thursday morning. She sat in the dock quietly, folding her arms as she waited for the magistrate to walk in. She remained unmoved as media photographers took turns taking pictures of her. However, disappointment covered her face after the court moved her bail application to Friday in order to verify her residential address. Her lawyer, only known as Moriri, told the court that he had handed over the document to “someone pretending to be the IO” (investigating officer) two days ago. Moriri said he has since gotten another document which he had given to the correct officer. Maseko trended on social media two weeks ago after she disappeared minutes after her husband Caswell was found dead at their estate home just outside the mining town. Its alleged that the two got into a drunken fight and Maseko stabbed Caswell before she fled the scene in her Range Rover which was later found abandoned in Pretoria. Social media users spread photos of her face calling for other to be on the lookout for her as she was wanted by police. She handed herself over to eMalahleni police two days later. Caswell was buried in a flashy affair last weekend. The bail application will resume on Friday. @lindilesifile The Star
