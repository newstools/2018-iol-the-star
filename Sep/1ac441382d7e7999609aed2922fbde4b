Club DJ, voice artist, radio jock and TV presenter DJ Sphectacula tells why he will be buying an iPhone XS. Do you have a dashcam in your car? No, I have good sound system though. What are your thoughts on dashcams? Makes sense for those in the surveillance and law enforcement fields to be able to gather real-time evidence. How often do you make video calls? Four or fives times a day. I like seeing the people I am close to, and luckily for us, technology has brought that to our age. When was the last time you sent a WhatsApp to DJ Naves? Just as I began answering these questions, and that buzz right now must be his response. What type of cellphone are you using? I use two phones. Main: iPhone X 256GB Second phone: Samsung S8. Apple recently launched iPhone XS and XS Max. Are you planning to buy either of them? Definitely the XS or Fomo will kill me. I’ve received my last two handsets on the day they were launched in Joburg, and this year will be no different. Which app do you find most useful in your phone? Whatsapp If you were to create an app that helps stop racism, what would it be and how would it work? I would call it ‘Spread Love’ and it would telepathically sense if the thought that you were having was racist or not and educate you differently. I believe that because of indoctrination some people genuinely don’t know that they are being racist, especially black people.  Since we are in times of zero tolerance, this would help a great deal towards eradicating that crap.   @SthembisoMedia
