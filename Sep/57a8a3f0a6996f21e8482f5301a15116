On Monday night  a fire broke out at the luxurious Fernridge Estate in Dainfern, which gutted a family home, with the property’s management blaming the lack of a fire engine in Lonehill for the tardy response of the city’s emergency services. Julia Knibbs, the estate manager at Fernridge, confirmed that management had called the Lonehill fire department, but were told the depot had no truck on site. She said fire trucks from Cosmo City and Randburg came too late to contain the blaze, but no one was injured. Robert Mulaudzi, spokesperson for the city’s emergency services department, said that Lonehill, like other parts of Joburg, was experiencing shortages in terms of fire equipment caused by several problems. “Yes, we do not have a fire truck at the Lonehill fire station. It is at the workshops for repairs,” he said. “We have a shortage of fire engines (in the city). Most are old and spend most of the time at the workshops instead of being on the road servicing our residents.” Asked whether residents in the Lonehill/Dainfern area had been informed of these shortages, as the community seemed to be unaware that their local department was ill-equipped, Mulaudzi said: “They (the community) are aware that we have a shortage of fire engines. The truck comes back for a few days and then goes back to the workshops.” The Joburg CBD fire, which claimed the lives of three firefighters earlier this month, exposed the grim reality of Joburg’s emergency department, with reports that only 17 of the city's 30 fire stations had vehicles. The Star could not get comment from the affected family. @khayakoko88
