A memorial service for the three fallen firefighters who died while battling a blaze in the Joburg CBD will be held on Wednesday at the Ellis Park Arena. Simphiwe Moropane, Mduduzi Ndlovu and Khathutshelo Muedi died at the Bank of Lisbon Building in the Joburg CBD last week. They had rushed there after a fire broke out on the 23rd floor. One firefighter died after slipping out the window and falling to his death, the other was burnt while the third died of smoke inhalation. Ahead of a memorial service, families, colleagues and members of the public will honour the fallen heroes outside the building. Traffic will be diverted on certain roads in the CBD from 9.30am to 11.am for a wreath laying ceremony. Johannesburg Metro Police Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the following intersections will be closed off to traffic,  Commissioner and Pixley Ka Seme Streets, Albertina Sisulu Road and Ntemi Piliso Street as well as Ntemi Piliso and Helen Joseph Streets.” Minnaar said JMPD officers will be on duty to direct traffic at all of the road closures and side roads. A guard of honour will be formed at the spot for the laying of wreaths. Motorists are urged to use Rissik and Ntemi Piliso Streets as alternative routes. @SthembisoMedia
