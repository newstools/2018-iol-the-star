Stiaan Scheepers, 9, from Rustenburg, flew the flag high when he came second at the Junior Mental Calculation World Championship which took place in Germany on Tuesday. Stiaan achieved a top 10 position last year at the championship and this year missed first place with a mere 101 points out of a total of 2500. At just nine years old, he was up against stiff international competition from competitors up to two years older than him, including the winner, from India. The Junior Mental Calculation World Championship tests the calculation capabilities of the children in three age groups: junior one (eight to 11 years old), junior two (12 to 15 years old) and junior three (16 to 19 years old). The catch was that all the calculations were done mentally. Stiaan, a Grade 3 learner from Laerskool Protea Park in Rustenburg, is said to be advanced for his age. Stiaan’s teacher, Carien Bull, believes he is more advanced in maths than all the educators in the school, including maths teachers. “It is phenomenal, but it is something you must see with your own eyes,” she said. During their maths class, Bull hosts “Class vs Stiaan” competitions to test his abilities. “His classmates will give him a number with five digits and he must multiply it by another five-digit number. He will do the sum on the board and the class will test him on the calculator,” she said. “We don’t use calculators and it takes the learners longer to test him on the calculator than it takes him to do it on the board.” Stiaan spends two hours every afternoon with his coach from A+Students, according to Bull. “He is a humble nine-year-old who loves stories and loves sweets,” she said. Stiaan will return to South Africa with his A+ Students coach on Thursday.
