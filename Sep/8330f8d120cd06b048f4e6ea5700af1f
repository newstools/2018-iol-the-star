Gauteng Premier David Makhura has released the names of the firefighters who died while trying to contain #JoburgFire. The names of fallen heroes are, Simphiwe Moropane, 28, Mduduzi Ndlovu, 40, and Khathutshelo Muedi, 37. "I am more than ashamed when there are lives lost," says Makhura about the three firefighters who died at the burning Bank of Lisbon building, a government building in the Joburg CBD that has been ablaze for over 24 hours.  Makhura says he will be meeting with students from a residence across the road from Bank of Lisbon. He says he understands that some students were allowed to go back into the building, but their student accommodation is "not safe".     The students, and workers from other neighbouring buildings were asked to evacuate their buildings. The fear rose from the structural integrity of the flame ridden Bank of Lisbon building.     “This fire is a disaster," says Makhura, who mentioned that he has already asked all Gauteng mayors in the metros to come assist. The building has been ablaze for over 24 hours and Gauteng Department of infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo says they have received reinforcements from Ekurhuleni and Tshwane to help extinguish the flames. “It should be possible to contain the fire to where it is.”     A total of 1115 employees were safely evacuated from the building. Officials will have a meeting at 5pm to discuss what to do with the findings from a report they received last week, regarding the state of seven other buildings. The details of said report will be shared next week, says Mamabolo who also states that other buildings will be sought for department employees. “From next week we will start looking for alternative buildings for the employees. We will not rush people to come back, but we also won’t have workers staying home for too long.”     The Star
