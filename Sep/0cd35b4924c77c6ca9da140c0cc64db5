Dlamini left her home in Mapleton to write her final practical exam at Netcare Clinton Hospital, in Alberton. She was with Bheki Mbatha but, according to her mother, Jabulile Malinga, the two never arrived at their destination. This incident follows the alarming crime statistics results that were released this week which revealed that 57 people are killed each day in South Africa. This equates to a 6.9% increase in the murder rate from the previous year’s statistics. Police Minister Bheki Cele said the high murder rate bordered close to that of a war zone. Malinga, who had just viewed her daughter’s remains on Wednesday, said she was in pain. “The invigilator called me to let me know that Cebi had not arrived for her practical exams,” said Malinga. She said the couple had left the house at around 5am and two minutes later, she had heard several gunshots. “But I thought that it was not my business”, she said. Malinga told The Star she received a call from police that she should check with the mortuary as there were two individuals who were found burnt in a car in Heidelberg. Dlamini’s sister, Zinhle Mthembu, said: “We could only identify her with her feet because the lady that lived with her hand-painted her toenails blue I know she loved her career. She would never just go missing. On Saturday, we were with her.” She said Dlamini’s boyfriend, Bheki, had slept over at the Cebile’s family home. Gauteng SAPS spokesperson Kay Makhubele said: “A case of murder was opened and when police found the car through investigation, the bodies were burnt beyond recognition.”
