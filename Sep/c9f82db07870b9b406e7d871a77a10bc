The fraud case against Matheba was postponed on Thursday at the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court due to her being out of the country and a bench warrant has subsequently been issued. The case against the renowned media personality relates to alleged unpaid personal taxes from 2008 to 2017, and company taxes for the 2014 to 2017 reporting periods. The State has yet to disclose the cumulative amounts owed. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said a bench warrant means a warrant of arrest has been issued " but in this matter, it has been held over till October 4 due to the fact that the summons was not served to Ms Matheba personally. "If she fails to appear on the 4th, the warrant will be effective. She will not receive any special treatment.” State prosecutor Duduzile Robertse said the media personality was served with a summons on September 10, but received the invitation to the US only on September 17. This meant that Matheba and her legal team were not taking these proceedings seriously, Robertse said. “The bench warrant was held over and would be effective on the morning of October 4, meaning should Matheba not be in court on that day, she would be arrested,” she said. Matheba’s attorney, Charl Coetzee, said the star was in New York for the Global Citizen event on Saturday, which celebrates Madiba.
