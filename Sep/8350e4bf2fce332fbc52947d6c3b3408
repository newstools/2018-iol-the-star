 I'm not gonna read the article.Just for the record.@TonyEhrenreich does not speak for me. I speak for myself! I didn't vote or ask Tony to speak on my behalf. I'm sure many Coloureds feel like this. That's right, WE ARE COLOUREDS. We are not black or White. https://t.co/tD6mvjoKOk  — Lorenzo White (@Official_LWhite) 
  September 19, 2018    But we aren't "black"! We are mixed-race. We have the right to associate ourselves with whomever we want but we aren't and will never be black or white. — Lorenzo White (@Official_LWhite) 
   September 20, 2018     It is unbelievably arrogant of Tony Ehrenreich to think he speaks for an entire community, and gives them a new name without even consulting said community. https://t.co/jTMswTNVP5 — Jonathan Vincent (@South_Asia_Risk) 
   September 20, 2018    Tony Ehrenreich assumes himself to be speaking for all of SA's coloured people. The man has delusions of grandeur. — Lee (@LeeP247) 
   September 20, 2018     @TonyEhrenreich: You don't need to write open letters to @CyrilRamaphosa, the last time I checked he was your fellow comrade. Lastly, majority of your community still openly identify themselves as coloureds. I am not sure when have you since change this.Stop being a hypocrite.  — Muli Malong (@muli_malong) 
   September 20, 2018       Like you @TonyEhrenreich I find it indictment on system that, a quarter of a century after universal suffrage, I need to contemplate a change in race classification, in SA where equal rights can be more equal than another, depending on ethnic genetics of distant ancestors. https://t.co/7ETvXQJBwN  — Graham Robert Evans (@cliviagraham)
