If all countries can legislate that every family has a maximum of three children, there will be: Less overpopulation; Less unemployment; Less poverty; Less illiteracy; Less crime; and, Less migration to greener pastures. Parents will be able to love them; Feed them; Educate them; Protect them; Clothe them. Male and female sterilisation should be encouraged and rewarded. If we earnestly start now, we will see the results in the next 20 years.
