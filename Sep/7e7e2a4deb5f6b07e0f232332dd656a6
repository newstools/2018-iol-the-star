The bodies of a retired British millionaire and his Thai wife have been found buried in their garden in northern Thailand after they were reported missing last week, police said. Alan Hogg, a 64-year-old retiree from Edinburgh, and his wife, 61-year-old Nod Suddaen, were reported missing after failing to meet their friend in Chiang Mai. Police found blood stains on the floor and in a wash room near the swimming pool at the house in Phrae province, 550km north of the capital Bangkok. Yesterday their bodies were found lying together in a two-metre hole on their estate, said deputy police spokesperson, Krisana Pattanacharoen. Three Thai men were arrested and have been charged with murder. One of the three suspects is Suddaen’s elder brother, Warut Satchakit. He allegedly hired the other two men to murder the pair. The men confessed to shooting Hogg and beating his wife to death with a hammer before burying the bodies in the couple’s garden, Phrae police chief Sanpat Prabputcha said. The motive for the crimes remains unclear, though police noted a prior family dispute and Satchakit’s alleged financial problems. dpa ANA
