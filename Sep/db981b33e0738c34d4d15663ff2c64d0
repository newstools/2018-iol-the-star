The use of traditional medicine is not new, but in most cases, it should not be used with conventional medicines. This was the message from the City of Ekurhuleni while celebrating African Traditional Medicine Day on Friday. The city’s executive manager for the multi-sectoral HIV/Aids unit, Thabiso Peo, said the use of traditional medicines was an alternative form of medical treatment, but he advises patients on chronic medication to avoid mixing medicines. “Some medicines counteract each other and some don’t. In this instance, it is advised that those who have been diagnosed, and are on chronic medication avoid mixing it with traditional medicines to allow proper monitoring of the effectiveness of the medication, and identification of any contraindication,” said Peo. In recognising traditional health practitioners (THPs) as important stakeholders in the health sector, the city’s health and social development department has formed a committee where traditional healers are trained on basic HIV/Aids factors, health policies, and universal precautions to take during consultations. “The committee ensures THPs identify symptoms of sicknesses that need medical attention, to test and promote early detection and treatment of preventable illnesses. “We also seek to dispel myths by bogus practitioners who claim to cure HIV/Aids and advise people to stop taking treatments that result in patients defaulting from their prescribed treatment,” added Peo. Traditional healers wishing to be a part of the THPs committee can contact the city’s Aids council secretariat office on 0119992448 or 0119992745. The Star
