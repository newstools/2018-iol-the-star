 Sthembiso Sithole (SS):What are some of the things you look for in a new phone? Candice Modiselle: The camera, followed by the price and if it’s attractive.  SS:What are your thoughts on the Gauteng Education Department’s online application process for pupils? CM: Online application is convenient. I’m not opposed to it, but at no point should those who are not computer-literate be marginalised.  SS: How do you think celebrities should use technology? CM: Public figures should never lose sight of their power and reach, particularly with the youth. Technology then becomes the vehicle to communicate that power and maximise their reach.  SS: Standard Bank recently launched a social campaign on Twitter to show that positive tweets can be turned into tangible educational tools with the help of 3D printing and laser cutters. Your thoughts? CM: For a big corporate to spearhead a project of this magnitude is commendable because it shows they are aware of the impact of social media.  SS: What technology-related blogs or websites do you follow? CM: The Forbes Africa platforms are diligent in communicating Africa’s innovations, globalisation and how the youth have become the architects of our technological narrative.  SS: What are your favourite technology products, and why? CM: My phone because of the range of things I can do on it, and it’s portable.  SS: What makes your Instagram account different? CM: I’d like to believe that my followers gravitate towards the believability and authenticity of who I am. @SthembisoMedia
