Johannesburg - Midland Primary and High School have been crowned the inaugural National High School Quiz champions. The four-member Joburg team of Neo Nkosi, Daniel Govender, Shweta Kistan and Ashley Nyadongo hugged each other and jumped for joy as they celebrated their hard-won victory. The winners were very closely followed by Eden College from Kwa- Zulu-Natal, who were the runner-ups, just a point behind. The National High School Quiz was hosted on Thursday at the IIE Varsity College Sandton campus. The competition is in partnership with the Daily News, The Star, Cape Argus, Pretoria News and sponsor IIE Varsity College. The eight teams of four from four different regions faced off and had 30 seconds to answer 10 questions from five categories, namely politics, sport, current affairs, business and entertainment. Ashley, from Midland, said he was elated that they had emerged as the top team. “We put in a lot of hours and work. We also worked on helping each other instead of saying ‘I’m good at this category, so I’ll do it’. We helped each other to say ‘this is where your faults are and I’ll put in some effort to help you out,” he said. The Midland team took home R20 000 for their school; each learner and their coach pocketed R5 000; they were awarded trophies and medals and an Ace IT study pack for each pupil with Ace IT backpacks. IOL editor Riana Howa said the reach of Independent Media came with a lot of responsibility. Varsity College principal Andre Lubbe said the one thing that this competition had done was focus the learners’ attention on current affairs. “Do yourself a favour, keep on reading, keep on picking up a newspaper on a daily basis and see what’s going on,” he said.
