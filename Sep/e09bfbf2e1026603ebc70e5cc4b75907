I have read with interest your article on property valuations and objections. I am an attorney who has been assisting property owners in relation to matters of this nature. There are a number of points I wish to bring to the attention of the reader: You refer to “complaints from readers about exorbitant bills despite having logged an objection to the increased valuations” Ratepayers are, not in fact, obliged to pay these exorbitant bills pending the outcome of their objections. They are entitled to base the amount of rates they pay during this period on their previous valuations. The city has, in fact, already conceded this in writing, but this may not be made clear on the rates bills. Municipalities often require ratepayers to pay a “prescribed fee” if they want to see the reasons for the outcome of their objection. This is done to discourage ratepayers who may be considering an appeal. No fee has been legally prescribed and municipalities are not legally entitled to charge such a fee. If they appeal against the outcome of their objections, the law provides that ratepayers may continue to pay rates based on their previous valuations pending the outcome of their appeal. The city has not yet conceded this point even though the legal basis thereof is clear Once the dispute concerning the valuation is finalised, the ratepayer will be obliged to pay the shortfall of any rates underpaid by him/her. Municipalities often charge interest on this shortfall. They are not, in fact, entitled to charge such interest, though they are obliged to pay interest if they need to refund any surplus rates paid by the ratepayer. The applicable rate is prime +1%.
