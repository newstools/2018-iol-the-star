Police are investigating a shooting of a 43-year-old man in what witnesses described as a hit. The victim was driving his blue Porsche near The Kloof Mall in Bedfordview and stopped at a traffic light. This is when two motorcyclists rolled up next to his car and opened fire. They shot the driver several times through the window of his Porsche and the bikers rode away. The driver later succumbed to his injuries. Bedfordview SAPS spokesperson Captain Andre de Jager said: "The 43-year-old man stopped at a traffic light on the corner of Van Buuren and Kloof roads when the two men on a motorcycle shot him." Reports said the man was a well-known figure in the Ekurhuleni area and he owned an undisclosed number of money and gold exchange shops. Nothing was taken from the victim's car, and the gunmen were still on the run, police sd. The Star
