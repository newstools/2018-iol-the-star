Eskom said access to electricity has improved from 36% in 1994 to 90% to date. Eskom said in 1994, at “the dawn of democracy”, only 36% of the country had access to electricity, with 12% being rural electrification.  To date, Eskom said yesterday, the programme is left with less than 300 000 unelectrified houses in its area of supply, and this figure excludes growth and informal settlements. Ninety percent of South Africans have access to electricity, and 80% in rural areas have been electrified through the Integrated National Electrification Programme. Eskom said to date, it has electrified in excess of 5 million households. “Eskom is as much part of South Africa’s heritage as our power lines and power stations are part of the South African landscape. “But it goes beyond that, our systems, processes, skills and expertise needed to run the grid are also part of a shared heritage,” said Eskom group chief executive Phakamani Hadebe. Hadebe said, “as an organisation that has been the cornerstone of South Africa’s economy, we continue to pride ourselves on our heritage of powering the nation”.  “We are forever mindful that electricity is a key enabler, driving the economy, education, social cohesion and individual and collective aspirations.” The Saturday Star
