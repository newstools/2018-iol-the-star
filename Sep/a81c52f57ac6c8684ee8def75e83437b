 Sthembiso Sithole (SS): Do you regard yourself as a responsible digital citizen? If, yes, why? DJ Naves (DJ): It's relative; the internet is the Wild Wild West, the digital space is ungoverned, so what I might think is right might be wrong to the next person.  SS: Out of 10, how would you rate your online skills? DJ: I am a strong 8, I can navigate my way around there.  SS: How likely are you to try multiple times with technology issues to make something work the way you want it to? Frequently, occasionally, never, not often or all the time? DJ: I try frequently. I just think you must try until you get it right, don't give up!  SS: What are you thoughts on virtual reality? DJ: I don't even know what virtual reality is, but it sounds cool.  SS: Do you have games on your smartphone? DJ: No, I don’t, social media is already a distraction so imagine if I had games. SS: If you could create your own game, what would it be and what rules would you like to have in your game? DJ: I think maybe I would create a game where you can restore cars and you get to go to races, or tracks and spinning competitions, that sort of thing. I think that would be really cool.  SS: If you could meet Minister of Science and Technology Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, name two questions or issues you would like to raise. DJ: I’d ask what they are doing to up the level of education in schools, bearing in mind how technology and science has affected the world. Second, I would ask; what is she telling her peers about dropping data prices, as without data there is nothing you can do.  SS: Name three gadgets that you think all DJs should have? DJ: You should definitely have a cellphone, headsets and USBs.  SS: Name one politician you would like to have a Skype online chat with? DJ: I'd like to have a chat with the president, just to hear his views on the land issue and crime especially, and whether they are selling our country to the Chinese or not. @SthembisoMedia
