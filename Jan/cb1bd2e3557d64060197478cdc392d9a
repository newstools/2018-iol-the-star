Former Assistant Director of Trade and Investment at City of Joburg, Londeka Ntjoboko, has resigned following allegations of her involvement in the fraudulent transfer of R800 000. Reginald Pholo former Director of the same department was also implicated in the same activity. The two were both suspended for transferring the money to a company of attorneys but Ntjoboko resigned immediately after she was discovered. Pholo, on the other hand, was dismissed. The City said in a statement that it had laid charges against the two and will pursue the recovery of the funds. It said the money was transferred to Pholo and Ntjoboko via accounts linked to companies they have a vested interest in and which they had failed to declare their interest in. MMC for Economic Development Leah Knott said the City would not tolerate corruption within its ranks and this problem would be dealt with accordingly. “We are committed to ensuring the City’s economic growth and reducing unemployment, which is hampered by such actions and will apply all of our resources in stamping out this dishonesty,” said Knott. Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba said despite continually educating employees about fraud and corruption,  he was disappointed to learn that there were still officials who partook in such activities. “We have zero tolerance for corruption and we will continue to vigorously pursue every allegation of corruption in collaboration with institutions such as the Hawks and other organizations within the criminal justice system,” said Mashaba. He also said that corruption did not just steal from the city and that its also robbed residents of much needed services and resources. For this reason Mashaba has urged and encouraged people to report any fraud and corruption activities through our 24-hour tip-off hotline 0800 002 587 or visit the GFIS offices situated at 48 Ameshoff Street in Braamfontein.
