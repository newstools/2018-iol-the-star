Johannesburg - Exactly three years after the accident in which Top Billing television presenter Simba Mhere was killed, driver Preshalin Naidoo was on Wednesday found guilty of culpable homicide by the Randburg Magistrate's Court. Magistrate David Mahango said in handing down judgment that "the court finds that the State has proven the facts beyond reasonable doubt that the accused wrongfully and negligently caused the collision that caused the death of Simba Mhere and Kady-Shay O'Bryan. The crash involved three cars and happened on January 31, 2015. During the trial Mhere's father testified that they were in one of two of the turning lanes off ramping on the Southern bypass of the N1 highway before they heard a big bang, which was Naidoo's car smashing into theirs. The second testimony came from Mamokete Laka who was travelling in the second vehicle that was involved in the collision. Laka said she heard the noise when the robot was orange. "It shows the accused was driving at excessive speed."
