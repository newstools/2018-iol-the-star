Johannesburg - Ithubu Holdings has given Lotto players a hundred million ways to banish “JanuWorry”. Lotto players have the opportunity to win a whopping R105 million jackpot in Wednesday’s draws. It is the largest offering since Ithuba took over as the official operator of the national lottery in South Africa in 2015. According to Sandisiwe Gugushe, the PR manager of Ithuba, the R105m is the combined amounts of the Lotto and two Lotto Plus jackpots. The national lottery operator’s head of marketing, Khensani Mabuza, said they were excited about the upcoming draws. “The Lotto jackpot now sits at an estimated R100m, which is a record amount for Ithuba. We are very excited as this is in keeping with our promise to our players of bigger jackpots more often, and we are calling on all South Africans to go out and play,” she said, The highest Lotto jackpot payouts since 2015 are as follows: November 4, 2017: A winner from the Eastern Cape won R 50 795 986.30; April 22, 2017: A winner from KwaZulu-Natal won R 34 494 651; July 30, 2016: A winner from KwaZulu-Natal won R 35 244 363.50. “We recently announced a PowerBall winner of just over R70 million. In 2016, we paid out our highest PowerBall jackpot amount of R87 million to a schoolteacher in Limpopo. Ithuba is now looking at making the same happen for our Lotto players,” according to Mabuza. She said the only way for people to win was to play, and this could be done on the national lottery website, banking channels and national lottery retailers. Ithuba said it understood the impact that overwhelmed winners could experience after winning a jackpot, and it had implemented “winner services” to assist them to “keep their cool”. The complimentary services are enabled to equip winners with the best tools to invest their winners and cope with this sudden life-changing event. These services include safeguarding winners' identities, financial advice, estate planning, legal advice, and trauma counselling. @Siphumelele_K The Star
