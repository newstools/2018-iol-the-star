But the dream of playing for Wits University Football Club died in Grade 10 when a window fell on his leg, injuring him.  After operations, doctors told Siviwe that he could not play soccer anymore.  Siviwe, a pupil at  Leseding Secondary School in Welkom, said though he was disappointed he could not pursue a soccer career,  he was comforted by knowing that he was smart enough to succeed academically.  Siviwe now plans to study actuarial science at Wits University after scoring four distinctions in his matric exams - Maths, Life Orientation, Mechanical Technology and Physical Science.  A member of  the representative council of learners, Siviwe had first wanted to study chemical engineering but changed his mind after a career day at his school.  “I used to love chemical engineering and I was doing well in mechanical technology at school. In Grade 10,  I lost interest in the subject and started exploring other things.” During a career exhibition at school, an actuary came to the school for a presentation.  “He told us about the job and I was like ‘wow, this is what I want to do’.  The course is about mathematics and I love mathematics.” The young man from the Free State said his final year in high school has been a good one though busy. His school offered extra classes every day at 6am and 6pm.  “Even though we didn’t have the chance to rest, I enjoyed the whole year.  I am at a technical school and I took mechanical technology and engineering graphics design. But mathematics is my favourite subject. I cannot love any subject like mathematics,” Siviwe said.  To save time, he studied only at school.  “I made sure I put more effort there because that is where I have my peers and teachers. I made sure I got out of school knowing exactly what I needed to know,” Siviwe said. “Apart from my school activities, I also participate in the community recycling project because I believe it is important,” Siviwe said.
