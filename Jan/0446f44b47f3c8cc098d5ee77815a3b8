It all started on Tuesday when the legendary former Bafana Bafana centre-back tweeted a picture of himself and jazz icon Sipho “Hotstix” Mabuse. He captioned it: “We love you forever”, under the impression the man in the picture with him was Hugh Masekela, who had died earlier in the day. He deleted the tweet soon afterwards and apologised. However, “Twitterville” was not in a forgiving mood.

As the challenge gained momentum, @ndaejustice tweeted businessman and socialite Kenny Kunene’s picture and captioned it “we miss you Intsimbi, Robbie Malinga”. Television host Anele Mdoda and her sister Thembisa also made it to the challenge when Thando M@ThandoM77478448 tweeted their picture together saying: “The Ranakas were so happy today.” The trend also hit Facebook - Blessing Khumalo posted a picture of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, saying it was DJ Black Coffee.
