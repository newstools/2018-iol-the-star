Celebrities came out to enjoy a day of sun and fun at the Sandton San Deck for the Safilo Group Havaianas Eyewear launch.
With the theme being kaftans and cut-offs, everyone came dressed for the part in gorgeous summer colours. Safilo Group is known for its high-end designer eyewear brands, such as Prada and Givenchy. The word Havaianas means Hawaiian in Portuguese. The weather added to the jolly mood with sunshine throughout the day. Some celebrities gave us their dreams for the year ahead: Taryn Louch, media personality: “My hashtag for this year is 20 Eight-Dream. I’m going to be a dream catcher in high mode. I’ve got some really exciting projects in the pipeline. I’m all about show business and we're taking that up a notch this year. "I have a one-woman show called Blonde coming up. And I have some radio and TV opportunities. You’re going to be seeing a lot of me." LeAnne Dlamini, singer: “I’m really hoping it’s a good year for myself and everyone around me. Also, that work is good and people find love truly. Just for it to be a beautiful and blessed year. "I know 2017 was hard on many people. So I’m really just hoping for a breakthrough for many people.” Thembisa Mdoda, presenter: "I came out guns blazing thinking I wanted to do everything and anything. And now I just want me-time. "My goal this year is to work smart and not necessarily hard, in career and relationships. I want to shift into a new gear. Also to learn something new every year. "I’m going to do Dancing with the Stars this year. I’m learning new dances. It’s tough but every day I learn something about my dance, my rhythm. "It’s going to be an incredible show. Something so spectacular, which is why we are putting in all the work. I’m enjoying it!” Also in attendance was Kelly Khumalo, Lalla Hirayama, Zuraida Jardine and Tumi Voster. The eye-wear collection will be available from March.  @mane_mpi
