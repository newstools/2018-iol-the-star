Since taking the Miss Universe crown in November, Nel-Peters has been making waves in New York and keeping her fans up to date on her social media pages. The beauty made history when she won the title and became the second South African to win the crown, after it was last worn by Margaret Gardiner in 1978. For her homecoming, the 22-year-old will take on a week of activities that include workshops in Soweto and Cape Town for her Unbreakable campaign. The campaign is an initiative to empower women in self-defence through training and education on how to handle tough situations they might find themselves in. Nel-Peters will also visit victims of the Knysna fires. The week-long celebration will see her mingle with the who's who of celebville at the annual Sun Met horse-racing event. She will also be treated to a street parade in her hometown of Sedgefield in the Western Cape. “Demi’s win has elevated national pride, inspiring thousands of young people. We all have an extra spring in our step and smile a little broader when our fellow countrymen and women excel on the international stage. Demi’s homecoming is an opportunity for all South Africans to join in the celebrations, and we couldn't be prouder. Thank you to everyone for their continued support,” said the Miss South Africa organisation. Nel-Peters recently attended the Golden Globes with Gardiner. She posted on her Instagram page: “I got to share this incredibly special moment with @margaret_gardiner, the first @missuniverse to be crowned from South Africa. Thank you for inviting me as your guest and for welcoming me with warm open arms.”  I got to share this incredibly special moment with @margaret_gardiner , the first @missuniverse to be crowned from South Africa.

The time of tolerating injustice is up,” she posted. Nel-Peters also posted about her time at the award ceremony, posing with model Kendall Jenner, taking a photo on the Hollywood Walk of Fame next to Charlize Theron's star, and bumping into her idol Kelly Clarkson.  💜💜💜 A post shared by  Demi-Leigh | Miss Universe (@demileighnp) on Jan 8, 2018 at 1:08pm PST  On returning home, Nel-Peters had this to say: “I can't begin to express my gratitude and how proud I am to represent our country as Miss Universe. "Being a global ambassador is as much a responsibility as it is an honour. Our nation comprises many different backgrounds and cultures, one of the many things that makes me immensely proud to be a South African. I am very excited to celebrate this achievement with my people in the spirit of Mzansi.”
