Johannesburg - Convicted racist Vicki Momberg's bid to appeal her conviction and three year sentence for crimen injuria has been postponed in the Randburg Magistrate's Court. Momberg appeared in court briefly on Monday morning where the case was postponed until February 20 next year. She was initially denied leave to appeal the ruling in the lower court but managed to have this overturned by the high court. In her appeal, Momberg argued to the high court that the lower court had failed to properly scrutinise her sane automatism defence, that the video evidence of her shouting at the officers had been tampered with, and that her own expert witness had been all but ignored. Meanwhile, she has argued that the sentence was excessive in relation to the crime. She was caught on camera using the K word 48 times to a police officer who was trying to assist her after she was involved in an alleged smash and grab incident in North Riding in 2016. The 49-year-old former real estate agent is the first person in South Africa to be handed a prison sentence for crimen injuria. She is currently on bail pending the outcome of her appeal. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. IOL
