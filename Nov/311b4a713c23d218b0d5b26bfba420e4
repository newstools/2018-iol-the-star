Johannesburg - A young mother will have to wait a little longer to find out her fate after she was found guilty of murdering her newborn baby. Zikhona Mndela was on Tuesday found guilty of murder and concealment of death after wrapping the newborn in plastic and a jacket before putting her in a 20 litre tin of paint. on Tuesday, Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng found that Mndela had not been "frank with the court” in the different versions she presented. In her version, after a night out with friends, she felt unwell. She suspected she had a stomach ache and when she went to the toilet nothing came out. After squatting and pushing for a while, the baby fell on the floor. The baby did not move or cry and she cradled it in the jacket. She claimed she put the baby girl in a tin of paint because she realised there was commotion outside and didn’t want people to take videos of the scene and put it on social media. Judge Mokgoatlheng disputed this and said: “This court rejects that the baby was born dead. It can’t be true because we have scientific evidence that the respiratory system was triggered when the baby was born. “The accused said she doesn’t remember who cut the umbilical cord. The court finds that she cut it herself with a blunt knife.” He said because the baby was born alive, Mndela had the intention of murdering her. “If the baby was born dead why wrap it in plastic and a jacket? This was done with the intention of murdering this baby. Everyone knows that if you wrap a baby in plastic it can’t breathe. Putting it in a bucket of paint and closing it also means the baby cannot breathe,” Judge Mokgoatlheng said. The judge also said it was untrue that she gave birth at 19 weeks as there was evidence from a doctor who stated that the baby was full-term. Mndela was released on warning until December 13 when the court will hear a report from a probation officer. Until then, she is expected to report to the Rabie Ridge police station three times a week. The Star
