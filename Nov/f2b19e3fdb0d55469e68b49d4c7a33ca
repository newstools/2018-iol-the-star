Speaking to The Star on Wednesday, Sadsawu Secretary General, Myrtle Witbooi, said the controversial two mugs with “The Maid” and “The gardener” written on them reminded her of apartheid. The photo of the mugs placed on a shelf angered a lot of social media users this week. Pick n Pay has since removed the offending mugs from their shelves but that has not placted Witbooi. “What Pick n Pay did was dehumanising. It took us back to apartheid years. Why are they giving titles? We are also human beings. “We are going to get all our members in all the provinces to participate in demonstrations outside Pick n Pay stores,” she said. Witbooi said they demanded an apology. “They (Pick n Pay) only care about money. How can they do such a thing? We want those mugs destroyed. The question is what are they doing with all the mugs, are they going to destroy them? They shouldn’t be given to poor people,” she said Toni Verna was the first person to expose a picture of the mugs that she said were at the store’s Observatory branch in Cape Town. In a series of tweets, Pick n Pay responded to the user and apologised. “Thank you for alerting us. This is completely unacceptable. We have contacted the store, and we can confirm that these mugs have been removed from the store, and are not stocked in any other Pick * Pay stores. “Thank you again for bringing this to our attention. This involved one franchise store only, and we had them removed from sale immediately," Pick n Pay said later. While the store said it had not been aware of the mugs, a caller on Radio 702 said it was unlikely that management would have not been aware of them. @SthembisoMedia
