It was revealed that Nyovest’s Family Tree company partnered with the Group two weeks ahead of #FillUpMosesMabhida. The musician and businessman, whose real name is Refiloe Maele Phoolo, said he was very excited about the partnership. “It has been over a year since Sipho Dlamini (managing director of Universal Music South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa) and I have been in talks and, fortunately, we were able to come to an agreement where I feel I still own my music, creativity, I am not bossed around and can still be an artist, growing and changing the game,” said Nyovest. He also said that the label has done great things independently and the road has been tough but worth it. Despite all the hiccups, he is proud of the progress and success so it was time to expand and focus on achieving more, by leaving his mark in the lives of artists and his fans. Dlamini said: “We are very excited as Universal Music Group to announce the signing and partnership with Casper and his label, Family Tree. It is not everyday that we get to work with such an established, dynamic, young and hard-working man, who has developed talent over his years in the industry. We all know the work that he has done. Thank you for deciding to make this your home and choosing our revolutionary label.” With three platinum albums under his belt, Nyovest will release his 4th album through Universal Music Group titled Sweet and Short on November 30. It will include a brand new single Sponono Sam featuring well-renowned Maskandi artist Shwi No Mtekhala. The release is a day before his #FillUpMosesMabhida concert. This is the third concert in #FillUp series and the first time it is taking place in Durban. Universal Music Group is also home to well-known artists like Dr Dre, G Unit, Nasty C and Lady Zamar.
