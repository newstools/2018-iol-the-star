perhaps if on day 17 our loved ones would wake up from their graves bodies unbattered necks untwisted  killers jailed or in the ground where they took others  it would be easier to understand these two weeks  but instead we are digging more graves  graves stretching for as far as our swollen black eyes can see  names trailing behind hashtags  none of them named lazarus none of them waking up none of them coming home  on day 17 the chanting is softer the dead have multiplied the mourners are fewer How to show your support: * Take the pledge against sexual harassment * Join and like Be The Change Mzansi on Facebook. * Follow the Don't Look Away campaign on IOL * Follow us on the Facebook pages of Daily News, Cape Argus and The Star.
