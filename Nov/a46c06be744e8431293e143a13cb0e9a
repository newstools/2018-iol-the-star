Many of the successes in improving the lives of residents in the City of Joburg have been due to the EFF. Speaking at the party offices at the metro council in Braamfontein this week, Gauteng EFF regional chairperson, Musa Novela said all the successes which city mayor Herman Mashaba and his coalition were claiming, had, in fact, been originated by the EFF. “The DA and its partners have no idea on how to improve the lives of people - the successes that they boast about have been ours, and, in fact people today call Mashaba an EFF mayor,” he added. Amongst the EFF successes were the release and expropriation of some 80 unused or hijacked buildings which will be turned into student and lower-income accommodation. The EFF said it was also responsible for the city’s insourcing of security staff and Pikitup workers. It had been behind setting up the Group Forensic Investigations Unit to eliminate corruption, as well as the extension of clinic working hours. Speaking on Mashaba’s constant call for illegal foreigners to return home, Novela said it was the EFF policy that Africa should be open as a continent without borders. It should have one currency and one leadership. “We want a united states of Africa. Anyone has the right be here - it is colonial laws which prevent people from other African countries from entering the country.” He also called on government to start making “massive” investments in roads and railway infrastructure in neighbouring countries which would attract investment there, create jobs and reduce the number of people coming to South Africa. Novela added that the party is aiming to “capture” Soweto from the ANC in next year’s general elections. “We already have a large following in Alexandra, Diepsloot, Ivory Park and Orange Farm, but the ANC still maintains a strong base in Soweto which we will be “finishing off” during the next elections. The party would be doing a lot of work there in the next few months, he added.
