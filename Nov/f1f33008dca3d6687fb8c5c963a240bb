News started doing the rounds on social media two weeks ago that China had opened 13 police stations across the country. But the Chinese embassy has come out guns blazing, saying its centres - called the South African-Chinese Community and Police Co-operation Centres - cannot be classified as police stations. The first such centre was established in 2004, said Yu Yong, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in South Africa. These centres have no authority to arrest or imprison people, he said.         “It is important to stress that the status of all these 13 centres are strictly non-profit Chinese associations and they have no law-enforcement authority. “The main responsibilities of the centres are to participate in the community policing mechanisms led by the SAPS and to co-operate closely with the SAPS in preventing and combating criminals against the Chinese community in South Africa,” Yong said. Deaths of Chinese nationals in South Africa due to crime averaged about 20 between 2004 and 2014, said the embassy. “Since their establishment, these centres have actively safeguarded the personal and property safety of local communities, including the Chinese community in South Africa, and have been warmly welcomed and widely supported by both Chinese and South African governments, as well as local communities,” Yong said.
