Johannesburg - Jabulani "HHP" Tsambo's father has disputed that Lerato Sengadi is his son's widow, saying the two were never married. Robert Tsambo said in court documents on Thursday that there was no "handover ceremony" to welcome Sengadi into the family, therefore, there was no customary marriage. The court papers were filed in response to Sengadi's court bid to interdict the family from burying him on Saturday in Mahikeng, North West, as planned. In the court documents, Sengadi said she was Tsambo's lawful wife and that Robert and/or those acting in his instruction must provide her with full details regarding the whereabouts of Tsambo's remains. "The respondent and or any person acting under his instructions is interdicted and restrained from making or proceeding with any further funeral arrangement's for the burial of the deceased; releasing the remains of the deceased to any person other than the applicant and burying the deceased." Sengadi said she and Tsambo had known each other for roughly 15 to 20 year but only became romantically involved in 2009. She said Tsambo paid R35 000 in lobola on the same day that they had their traditional ceremony. She also claimed in documents how she allegedly saw Tsambo in bed with another woman during a Facetime conversation, something that led to her leaving the "matrimonial home". That, she said, caused the hip-hop icon's life to spiral "out of control". The matter was postponed until 1pm. The Star
