A Tembisa woman has been found guilty of murdering her newborn baby girl and concealing her death. Zikhona Mndela 23, was found guilty by the South Gauteng High court on Tuesday for the 2016 murder of the the baby girl she murdered after giving birth alone in the bathroom. After the birth, she wrapped the baby with a plastic bag, covered her in a black jacket and placed her body in a 20litre bucket of paint. Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng found that the accused was “ not frank with the court”. Mokgoatlheng rejected Mndela’s claims that the baby was born dead. “It can’t be true because we have scientific evidence that the respiratory system was triggered when the baby was born,” he said. The matter was postponed to December 13 for a probation report. Mndela is currently on a warning and her legal representative is trying to get it extended until sentencing.
