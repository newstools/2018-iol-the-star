The #NoExcuse movement has urged South Africans to take action against Gender Based Violence, by recording 16 seconds of silence over 16 days of activism. The movement was launched a year ago by Carling Black Label in the build up of International Men’s day to challenge and propel South African men to be men of stellar and positive influences. The aim of the movement is to make men understand that alcohol is not an excuse to abuse their partners and children. Grant Pereira brand Director of Carling Black Label said gender based violence was a problem caused by men and it was up to men to take action and put an end to those atrocities in our society. "As a leading beer brand amongst South Africans, and a brand that seeks to rally a new order of champions, we want to challenge the men of our nation to take a symbolic stand,” he said. The challenge being issued is for men to show their commitment to end the scourge of  abuse and violence in South Africa by recording themselves in a silent 16-second video and uploading it to social media. “Using the power and reach of the Carling Black Label brand, we’re taking further action by releasing 5 million special edition #NoExcuse cans over 16 Days of Activism to drive the message that real men take action against GBV, and that there is never any excuse for women abuse,” Pereira said. Andrea Quaye, Vice President Marketing of SAB echoed Pereira’s sentiments and said  it was the organisation’s belief that the campaign was supporting the eradication of Gender Based Violence from our society so the next generation could grow up in a better society. “Our decision to launch the #NoExcuse movement was driven by Carling Black Label’s status as a lighthouse of modern masculinity, and as the largest beer brand in the country, we strongly believe in the responsible consumption  of alcohol, and that the abuse of alcohol is no excuse for women abuse."
