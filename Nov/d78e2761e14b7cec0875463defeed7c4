Starting this weekend, the Joburg Film Festival will be showcasing the work of creatives from 16 countries.  Now in its second year, the festival will curate more than 40 African films at venues across the city. The festival will be open to the public, with screenings in areas including Alexandra.  The films on show will include documentaries, animation features, various outreach screenings, exclusive premiere events and private parties. “As one of the continent’s leading film industry gatherings this year, the NFVF (National Film and Video Foundation) is fully behind the Joburg Film Festival.  “The festival will host a contingent of international actors, directors and other key stakeholders, adding to the growth of the industry in the city. We look forward to hosting yet another successful year celebrating African film,” said Shadrack Bokaba, acting chief executive of the NFVF. The Joburg Film Festival has partnered with the internationally renowned Discop Africa film and television market, which will be offering a network opportunity for global, local and continental creatives and business. “As part of the department’s commitment to supporting market access platforms towards the growth of the local film industry, Discop Africa and the Joburg Film Festival are key in not only creating an environment for commercial growth but celebrating South African film content and that of the African diaspora as a whole,” said the senior manager of cultural development, Lindiwe Ndebele-Koka.
