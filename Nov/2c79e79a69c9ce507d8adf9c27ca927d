The closing date for National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) applications is drawing closer. The funding scheme has also warned it would not accept any more applications from public college and university students after the closing date. “We wish to emphasise that there will be no extended window period for the 2019 applications, therefore the NSFAS will not accept any late applications after the 30 November, 2018, deadline. “NSFAS has communicated to all vice-chancellors and TVET principals that the closing date for applications is 30 November... and that no extension will be granted.  “Institutions were also informed that NSFAS-funded students with a confirmed bursary offer should not pay a registration fee when they present themselves for registration in January 2019.” Applications opened on 1 September to anyone wishing to further their studies at any of the country’s 26 universities and 50 in 2019 on an approved course at any public university or technical and vocational education and training college. Applications have been coming in thick and fast.  “On average, NSFAS has been receiving 3 500 applications a day,” said administrator Randall Carolissen. “The numbers can be attributed to the easy-to-complete online application system that allows applicants to complete the application within five minutes.” At a recent press briefing, Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane urged students who were yet to apply to do so urgently. “Students are strongly encouraged to submit online applications or visit their nearest National Youth Development Agency centre before the closing date,” Mokonyane said.
