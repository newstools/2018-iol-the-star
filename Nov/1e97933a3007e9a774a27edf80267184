Free State- A pensioner who decided to use a candle at night as he believed the electric light bulb made his bedroom hotter died of smoke inhalation when the candle tipped over and the mattress caught fire. This occurred as temperatures in the Free State, especially around Bloemfontein, rose up to 37°C this week. On Wednesday night, for the third time in a row, the 72-year-old pensioner is alleged to have gone to bed and left a candle burning. However, he was found dead on Thursday morning. Speaking on behalf of the family, Oupa Motlhabane said it was believed that the old man’s mattress caught the fire from the candle which must have tipped over. The smoke and fumes are believed to have caused the pensioner to suffocate in his sleep. He was found lying dead in bed on Thursday morning with burn injuries as well. Another relative Benny Motlhabane, who is also a neighbour, said he saw the smoke around five in the morning and immediately called the police and other neighbours. Although the fire brigade responded quickly, it was already too late, he said. Nono Moiloa, who is a local tuckshop owner in the area said the sales of cooldrinks has increased over the week due to the extreme heat. “I had to buy stock twice already in a week because it is hot and people want something cold,” she said. – Health-e News.
