Bonang Matheba’s tax woes have come to an end, after she agreed to pay a fine. The media personality and businesswoman, who was charged with tax evasion, appeared at the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court yesterday and allegedly settled the dispute with the SA Revenue Service following an admission of guilt and paying a R30 000 fine. Matheba’s manager, Davin Philips, said she was “happy the matter has been resolved”. “The matter has been struck off... we complied and we look forward to moving forward. As I’ve said before, Bonang is a law-abiding citizen and she’s happy the matter has been resolved,” said Philips. The reality TV star faced charges on her personal tax from 2008 to 2017 and company tax from 2014 to 2017. She faced 15 counts of tax evasion-related charges, 11 of them for her personal taxes and four related to her company. The Being Bonang star paid R22 000 for personal taxes and R8 000 for company taxes, listed under Bonang Matheba Entertainment (Pty) Ltd. The State prosecutor informed the court that Matheba had paid an admission of guilt fine and, therefore, they were requesting that the matter be removed from the court. The request was granted by the judge. The Star
