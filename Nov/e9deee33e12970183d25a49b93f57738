A man is in a critical condition with internal burns wounds as well as burn wounds on his face and neck after being burnt in an explosion at work. The man and three others who were also injured were part of the staff who were inside the building when it exploded on Thursday afternoon. The explosion was so powerful that some of the roof sheeting and others chemicals from the workshop they were working in were scattered as far as 50m away. The incident happened at Richbay Chemicals in Boksburg. William Ntladi of the Ekurhuleni Emergency Services said when they arrived at the scene, the factory's workshop was alreadyÂ  on fire. He said the explosion could be seen and heard from a distance and that some of the 210 litre containers from within the workshop were ejected through the roof. "The company deals with different chemicals that are corrosive. We don't know what they do with them but there were different containers ranging from 5litres to those as big a 1000litres. "The report that were received was that the chemicals caused the fire," Ntladi said. He said the three other men who were injured did not have burn wounds from the fire and that they were burnt by the chemicals as they were of a corrosive nature.
