Nomnganga, better known as the rapper Gxarha in the Eastern Cape, was born with an albinism and is partially sighted. As November focuses on Disability awareness, the Southern African Disabled Musicians Association (SADMA) will host its annual concert highlighting talented musicians and Nomnganga is one of them. “Just because you don’t see a disability in someone else, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. People need to understand that even disabled people can do whatever they want. I am living my life and chasing my dreams.” The rapper grew up with music around him, so it was a natural progression to make it a career move. “I love music, but I can’t sing. I ended up falling in love with hip hop. It was easy for me to write, because I love poetry as well.” He started writing poems in Grade 7. However, the 24-year-old says the journey has been hard. “It’s not easy to involve yourself in art as there are challenges. “Not everyone is going to accept and appreciate what you are doing. Some people take you for granted, others discriminate against you, and others appreciate want you are doing. People you work with treat you differently. “It’s not easy, but this is a calling I have to push. Today, I’m here because I understand myself and the environment I am in and trying to teach the small kids that come after me.” His poetry writing and rap skills have allowed him to thrive. He is now working with SADMA on a new 12-track album. “What I like about them is that they push me and support me as well.” The concert will take place at Vereeniging Town Hall in Sedibeng on Saturday.
