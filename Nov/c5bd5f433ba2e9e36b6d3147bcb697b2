Experts said the findings are particularly important for older mothers, who tend to try to have several children in a short period, to complete their family before their fertility declines. The study, which analysed 148500 Canadian pregnancies over a decade, found a gap of less than 12 months was the most dangerous - increasing the risk of maternal death, premature birth, stillbirth and low birth weight. Waiting for 12 to 18 months was the safest option, after which the risks very gradually rose again. Study leader Dr Laura Schummers, whose findings are published in JAMA Internal Medicine, said: “Our study found increased risks to both mother and infant when pregnancies are closely spaced.” Experts from the University of Colorado, writing in the same journal, said women increasingly feel pressure to leave shorter gaps between pregnancies because they are starting families at an older age and know their fertility will decline. That trend is mirrored in the UK, as more women focus on their career before having children. In 2016 the average age of a first-time mother in England and Wales was 28.8 - up from 23.5 in 1970. Mandy Forrester of the Royal College of Midwives said: “It will be a woman’s choice how long they leave between their pregnancies. What is important is that they are aware of the evidence.” - Daily Mail
