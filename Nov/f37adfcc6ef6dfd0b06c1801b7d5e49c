Yesterday, Mziwamadoda Kalako, portfolio committee on communications member, said he wants the broadcaster’s board and executives to come to Parliament and explain the SABC’s damning report into sexual harassment. Kalako was reacting on the release of its commission of inquiry into widespread sexual harassment, including sex for jobs or for favours. A range of abuses were uncovered by the inquiry, which included: * A perception of collusion between the SABC’s human rescources (HR) department and senior managers to cover up for alleged perpetrators, including the “poor and inept handling of cases”; * A fear of job loss by speaking out against abuses, lack of trust in HR, and the SABC’s inability to address gender-based violence; and * That none of the alleged perpetrators - all of whom were men - had ever been suspended or found guilty of sexual harassment. Altogether, there were 17 cases lodged by victims and whistle- blowers, where 11 alleged perpetrators were interviewed, and two “arrogantly” refused to appear before the commission. One of the victims, whom commission chairperson Barbara Watson said was repeatedly harassed on her first week at the SABC by a senior manager, had to be hospitalised due to the stress caused by the abuse. Kalako said the portfolio committee had yet to be briefed on the report, and he first heard about its release when he saw the live broadcast on TV. “So, we will definitely want the SABC to come and brief us so that we tackle this. “We can’t encourage sexual harassment, especially this thing of exploiting women with this so-called ‘sex for jobs’, or for a woman to be made to sleep with a man for a salary increase or a promotion. “The HR and the executive will have to explain to us how this did happen under their noses. We may also want to call the victims themselves to get to the bottom of this thing,” Kalako said. @khayakoko88
