Johannesburg - Home Affairs officials and former prison warders are set to appear in court on Monday morning over allegations that they hatched an elaborate plan to assist in the illegal release of prisoners for a fee. They will be joined in the dock by the inmates, all of whom are foreign nationals who had been arrested for drug trafficking. According to a source close to the investigation, the scheme unravelled when one of the femaleÂ drug mules was arrested in 2016. Police had received information that a woman inmate had allegedly been impregnated by a prison warder from the Johannesburg Prison and subsequently wrongfully released on parole. The woman had allegedly been kept in a private cell - allegedly for prison warder to have easy access to her. When the woman fell pregnant, the warder is alleged to have hatched a scheme to have her illegally released on an early parole. Instead of being deported, she was allegedly taken to a house in Soweto and she later aborted the baby. Police traced her to the Soweto house where she was later arrested and further investigations revealed an intricate plot that had seen many other inmates fraudulently released on parole. "One by one we found them in different locations around Johannesburg. They were in houses in Soweto, Hillbrow and Yeoville," the source said. According to the source, it was discovered that after the inmates were illegally released Home Affairs officials - who were in cahoots with the plotters - did not take the inmates back to Lindela to be deported to their home countries. "Both the prison warders and Home Affairs officials shared the money that the inmates paid for their unlawful release," the source said. While the inmates have been charged with escaping from unlawful custody, the home affairs officials and prison warders face charges of corruption and aiding and abetting the illegal release of prisoners.
