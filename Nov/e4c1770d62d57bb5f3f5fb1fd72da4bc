Johannesburg - A Kagiso woman has been charged with murder after her husband was found unconscious and unresponsive in a bathtub filled with hot water. The man, whose entire body was badly burnt, clung to life for three days. Police initially opened an inquest case but began suspecting foul play when they took a closer look at the evidence. The wife, Lungile Ntuli, was arrested on Wednesday, more than a month after her husband's death. Ntuli appeared at the Kagiso Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Speaking to The Star, Kagiso police spokesperson Warrant Officer Solomon Sibiya said the woman told them that on October 3 she left the house to go grocery shopping at around 11 am. According to Ntuli, her husband told her that he was planning to take a bath while she was away. Sibiya said Ntuli told police she arrived home around 4 pm and was startled to see water seeping from under the kitchen door. Ntuli allegedly opened the door, shouting her husband's name and following the watery trail to the bathroom. "She said when she arrived there, the taps were closed but her husband was inside the bathtub and that it looked like he had been burnt by boiling water. She said she ran outside and screamed for help. Neighbours responded and found the husband inside the bath with burn injuries. They rushed him to the local hospital in a serious condition," Sibiya said. Sibiya said they questioned the woman but her story did not gel with the results of their investigation and she was subsequently taken into custody. It is not yet known how long the man had been in the bathtub before he was discovered. The Star
