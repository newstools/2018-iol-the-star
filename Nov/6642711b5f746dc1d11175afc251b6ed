Johannesburg - The alleged predatory nature of a Soweto school patroller who is accused of shocking sexual abuse was revealed by an 8-year-old girl. The 8-year-old girl was testifying at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in the Palmridge Magistrate's Court on Wednesday against Johannes Molefe; a former patroller at the primary school who is facing three rape counts and 11 of sexual assault for allegedly violating 13 girls aged between 5 and 13 last year. The girl, who is currently in Grade 3, said she and her classmates were sweeping their class after the school day when the assault happened. Molefe allegedly waited for the other children to leave and then called her into his guard-room. The girl added there was no one else in the room. "He (Molefe) brushed my thighs and he put his finger inside my vagina and fiddled his finger inside. I felt pain. I went outside crying and he told me not to cry. He wiped my tears and I went to my (scholar) transport," the little girl said. She added that she only reported the matter to her mother sometime after the alleged rape because she was afraid her parent would confront Molefe, and he would then bully her. Asked by defence advocate Lumka Qoqo why she didn't scream for help if she was in pain, she said she couldn't because Molefe had covered her mouth with his hand. But Qoqo dismissed the girl's testimony, saying if Molefe had indeed covered her mouth, she would have mentioned it in her evidence in chief, and not during cross-examination. "Mkhulu (Molefe) denies ever putting his finger in your vagina and fiddling with it," Qoqo said. Molefe has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The trial continues. @khayakoko88 The Star
