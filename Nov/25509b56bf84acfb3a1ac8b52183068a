Pretoria - President Cyril Ramaphosa is announcing changes to his Cabinet from the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The reshuffle follows the recent resignation of controversial Minister of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba and the death in September 2018 of Minister of Environmental Affairs, Edna Molewa. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande has been acting as home affairs minister while Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom has taken care of the environment portfolio. Since taking office in February, Ramaphosa has only effected one Cabinet change, appointing Tito Mboweni as finance minister following the resignation of Nhlanhla Nene. Media reports this week have suggested the president would combine several portfolios in the economics cluster to create a "super-ministry" to spearhead efforts to revive growth and attract investment.
