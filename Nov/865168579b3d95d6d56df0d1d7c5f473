Mayor Herman Mashaba visited the area last week following protests after the city moved in teams to remove illegal connections, leaving the area in the dark. Mashaba said he had met with some of the community leaders to provide them with an update on the city’s plans for the electrification and development of the township. “The electrification of the area forms part of our overall implementation plan for the development of Zandspruit. During my visit, we discussed the community’s concerns regarding the safe electrification of the area, after the saddening news of the passing of two children who died after they were exposed to illegal electricity connections in the area.” Despite the council’s electrification programme being already closed for the financial year, Mashaba said he had asked the council to accept a report on Zandspruit as an urgent item. As a result, some of the following resolutions were taken: The original Zandspruit occupants should be the beneficiaries The allocation of beneficiaries residing within Zandspruit in the Zandspruit extensions 83 to 85 developments be approved and a list be made public The budget be made available during the next budget adjustment cycle The city fast-tracks negotiations with Eskom towards achieving an agreement of electrification of Zandspruit That a Joburg metro police satellite station be set up to ensure and strengthen the safety of the residents and improve police visibility around Zandspruit. Mashaba said he had requested the Minister of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba, to conduct an audit of the community to ensure undocumented persons are properly processed.
