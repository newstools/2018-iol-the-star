Dremo released a new song, Bigger Meat, the video of which was released on Twitter last week. Bantwini, who was notified by fans on Twitter, said he was shocked by this and plans to take legal action against Dremo. “I saw this on Twitter. Someone said to me, Zakes, this is your song. He tagged me and I was like, this is my song,” Bantwini said. The 38-year-old had initially sent a series of tweets to Dremo appealing to him to acknowledge what he had done.          Dremo is signed under Davido Music Worldwide, and his music video has 90600 views. Bantwini confirmed to The Star that he met with his publishers, and they had decided to give Dremo until close of business yesterday to respond to them. The song was released under Sony Africa. @SthembisoMedia
