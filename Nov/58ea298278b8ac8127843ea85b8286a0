It was revealed last week that Mahlatse Ramatseba, 29, was the alleged creator of numerous fake-news distributors, including mzansistories.com, mzansinewsonline.com, allnews1.com, dailyreport.co.za and others. Ramatseba’s sites published a number of fake-news stories, the most recent claiming that former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba had filmed a sex tape for his underage girlfriend. Mzansistories also published articles about the alleged Dros rapist, claiming that the accused was black, despite this being false, leading to confusion among social media users. Ramatseba was unwilling to comment last week. When asked about whether he believed his news sites had created racial division and spread misinformation, he immediately hung up the telephone. Ramatseba is an administrative assistant at Unisa's Sunnyside campus in Pretoria. Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela confirmed the 29-year-old’s employment at the university. “The university views this matter in a serious light and has accordingly initiated an internal investigation. "Appropriate action will be taken as directed by the outcome of the investigation and within Unisa policy prescripts,” said Ramotshela. “Fake-news articles should be condemned in the strongest terms,” he added. When asked about the potential ramifications of Ramatseba’s fake-news sites spreading distrust and misinformation, Ramotshela said: “Unisa condemns all forms of racism and discrimination and the spreading of misinformation. "This matter, as it relates to Ramatseba, will be the subject of the internal investigation that has been initiated.”
