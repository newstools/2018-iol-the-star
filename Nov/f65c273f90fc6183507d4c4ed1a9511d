The factions have been at loggerheads since the church leader and founder Comforter Glayton Modise died in 2016. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said one group drove towards the church allegedly to ambush the rival group that was inside. “The ones inside the church saw the approaching cars and a shootout ensued. One person was shot and he was taken to hospital,” Masondo said. The rival group retreated under heavy gunfire and at least 13 vehicles were damaged. Masondo said: “The other group then used stones to damage the cars.” He said police confiscated a number of firearms that would be taken for ballistics checks. Police cordoned off the streets leading to the church’s headquarters for most of the morning, combing the crime scene. Last year, members took each other to court over claims that more than R110-million was missing from the church coffers. Police are investigating a case of attempted murder and malicious damage to property.
