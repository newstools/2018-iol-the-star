The City of Joburg’s emergency management services (EMS) said there will be persistent high temperatures until Saturday and officials will be on high alert to respond to any emergency which might occur, as quickly as possible, said EMS spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi. The heat can result in cramps, exhaustion or heatstroke. The EMS as issued the following tips: * Keep indoors if possible. * Keep cool by taking lots of fluids and wearing light clothing. * Protect young children by wearing hats and sunscreen - outside playtime for children should ideally be restricted or prohibited between 10am and 4pm. * Stay away from direct sunlight especially between 11am and 3pm. * Cool yourself by visiting your local municipal swimming pools, which have lifeguards on site. * If working outside, wear protective clothing and take breaks at regular intervals. * Avoid playing strenuous sports or engaging in excessive manual labour, as one runs the risk of heat exhaustion or sunstroke. * The wearing of hats, preferably with a wide brim, as well as the generous application of sunblock should be encouraged if one is outdoors for any length of time. The EMS have also warned of the possibility of veld fires. The SA Weather Service has defined a heatwave as: “If the maximum temperature is expected to meet or exceed five degrees Celsius above the average maximum temperature of “the hottest month” for that particular place, as well as persisting in that mode for three days or more, then a heatwave may be declared.” Meanwhile, the city has also warned residents that water restrictions are still in place: * No watering of gardens from 6am to 6pm in the day. * Do not use hoses to wash down sidewalks and driveways. * Do not wash cars using a hose.
