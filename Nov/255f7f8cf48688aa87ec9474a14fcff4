Johannesburg- One of the Soweto primary school teachers who was part of the group of teachers removed after a wide range of sexual abuse was uncovered at the school has resigned. The Gauteng Education Department had removed six teachers from the school as well as the principal when news broke that the school patroller, Johannes Molefe, 58, had allegedly raped and sexually abused pupils at the school premises. They teacher, as as well as the principal, were moved to neighbouring schools in the area pending the finalisation of disciplinary proceedings against them over allegations that they knew about the abuse but swept the matter under the carpet. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona confirmed that the teacher resigned in December last year. No further action will be taken against the teacher. Asked why the others teachers were still teaching and not suspended or asked to report to the district office, Mabona said it was because they were not found to have molested the children. The issue, he said, was how the events unfolded under their watch and allegations that they did nothing. Another thing, Mabona said, they could not let the teachers stay home when there is a shortage of teachers. Molefe, faces three counts of rape and 11 of sexual assault for allegedly molesting 13 schoolgirls aged between 5 and 13 last year. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Star
