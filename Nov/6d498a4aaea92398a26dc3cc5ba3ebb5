Horse groomers who went on a strike in Johannesburg in June over wages and working conditions might not be better off any time soon as there is confusion over which government department they fall under. The parliamentary portfolio committee on labour heard that the industry was affected by three different departments: agriculture, due to horse breeding; trade and industry, for the gambling; and labour, because of the employment opportunities it offered. Geoff Woodruff, a prominent horse trainer, spoke of the need for a national grooms’ wage. “While we do work with animals, we work in entertainment and most of our work falls at night time. We don’t know how to adjust our hours, we would like to have a sector. “Government should discuss what could work for us.” Woodruff said the industry had difficulties complying with the laws. He was addressing the committee on a voluntary basis. He said there was no association representing trainers - a self-regulated industry. According to Woodruff, trainers in Joburg paid grooms more than those in Cape Town. He said as trainers they were trying to get a national grooms’ wage. He said grooms in Johannesburg earned about R4 300 a month, while riders, who are independent, are paid R20 per ride. He said of the 160 trainers inspected, only 5% were non-compliant with UIF contributions. Last year in June, grooms, with support from the EFF, embarked on a strike at the North Rand Training Centre in Randjesfontein. The demonstration was over the alleged “slave wage” and living and working conditions grooms faced. The Star
