Women running out of time to have babies are freezing their eggs to avoid "panic parenting" with the wrong man. British researchers interviewed 31 women who have put their eggs on ice for non-medical reasons. The research also found that most were single or with a partner who was unwilling to try for a baby. Dr Kylie Baldwin, of De Montfort University in Leicester, said: "Women did not want to be panicked into relationships they would not consider otherwise just because they wanted a child."  Younger eggs are better quality, so can be stored and used later to improve the chances of having a healthy baby. The study, published in the journal Human Fertility, also warns women about the low success rate using frozen eggs - estimated to be 20% for women over 36. Dr Baldwin said: “Clinics providing this technology have a responsibility to support informed decision-making.” Daily Mail
