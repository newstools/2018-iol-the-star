Johannesburg - What millions? Four jailbirds who defrauded Eskom have thrown this question to the State in a bid to discourage it from confiscating their properties. Judge Leonie Windell heard the State’s application at the South Gauteng High Court on Friday for a confiscation order against Jeanette Chiliza, 61, her son Nqobile Chiliza, 26, Themba Dlamini, 36, and Tlhaloganyo Matthews, 31. The four were jailed last year for defrauding Eskom by selling its electricity units illegally in De Deur, south of Joburg. The National Prosecuting Authority proved during the trial that Eskom lost over R4.5million to the brazen fraud. The Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) is now seeking to recover that money. The cash-strapped Eskom revealed that it lost about R4bn each year due to illegal sale of units, meter tampering and illegal connections. Victory for the AFU in court could see the Chilizas losing properties, including their family home. The legislation under which the AFU brought its application was clear that even property acquired before the fraud could be confiscated to recover Eskom’s lost revenue, advocate Sibusiso Mbatha told court. Representing the AFU, Mbatha said the section of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act applicable to the matter “does not necessarily require that there be a link between the property and the benefit”. Arguing for the defendants, Advocate Dumisani Mkhwanazi denied that they derived anything close to R4.5m from the fraud. To begin with, they sold the vouchers at half the price, "reason why residents opted for them,” he said. Mkhwanazi said the State could assure itself that the four had never seen a million rand in their lives by looking into their bank accounts and lifestyles before their arrests. Also, the loot was shared among many others, Mkhwanazi argued. Mbatha challenged the jailbirds to prove how much they received from the crime. Judge Windell reserved judgment. The Star
