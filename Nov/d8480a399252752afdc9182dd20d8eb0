Johannesburg - Police are looking for a young woman whose live-in lover was found dead on their bed with rat poison called Galephirime next to him. Although the lovers had lived together for almost a year, there was no trace of the woman, known only as Maria, as she had taken all her belongings when she left. It's not known if the man was killed or whether he committed suicide, but police are hoping that the woman will be able to help solve the mystery. According to the spokesperson of the Kagiso police station, the man's friend was worried when two days went by without seeing him. He is alleged to have gone to the house that the couple shared in Rietvallei on November 10. Have you seen Maria? Kagiso Police are looking for her in connection to the death of her boyfriend.
