Ndifelani Ligege, 40, of Amsterdam, Mpumalanga, is dragging the provincial education department to court over a stand-off that has seen him chased out of the classroom, while still receiving his salary, since January 2015. The Umlambo Combined Secondary School teacher is suing the department to the tune of R1.5m for defamation, medical expenses over depression and “psychological trauma” his family have suffered. Ligege disposed in court papers that he had been forced to report for duty at the circuit for the past four years. He stated under oath that the last time he was in the school, the principal, Enock Yende, called him to his office and “insisted that I should go if I didn’t want to get hurt”. This episode had been preceded by what Ligege described as his “peculiar and unlawful” dismissal from the school. Accusing him of shoddy work and lack of discipline, the school dismissed Ligege in December 2014. This shocked Ligege, he said, because his performance as an English and life sciences teacher had never been questioned since he joined the school in 2010. “I received my pay progression for 2014, which proves that my performance was superb,” he said in the affidavit. The department declared his dismissal illegal and instructed the school to allow him back by January 2015. But once again, threats of violence diverted him to the circuit office. Mpumalanga department of Education spokesperson, Jasper Zwane, would not indicate whether they planned to oppose Ligege’s application. Ligege believed he's being victimised because he blew the lid on what he believed was corruption at the school in 2014, regarding a teacher who allegedly was still being paid her salary several months after she had resigned. Ligege told The Star he had received his R270 000 a year for the past four years while holed up at circuit. “Guess what, I also get the performance bonus, which I should get by virtue of going to class. I get it every year,” he said.
