Johannesburg - The man accused of killing his girlfriend by dousing her in petrol and setting her alight made his first appearance in court but without a lawyer. Allegations are that Mpho Thobane attacked his late girlfriend after finding out that she had chatted with her ex-boyfriend. The lack of legal representation caused the case to be postponed to Monday, Magistrate Lucas Van Der Schyff said. Thobane, who appeared at the Johannesburg Magistrate's court, was officially charged with murder and arson for the brutal killing of Viwe Dalingozi on October 26 inside their Joburg apartment. Police spokesperson Xoli Mbele said in a statement this week that Thobane had an argument with Dalingozi. He is alleged to have then poured petrol over her while she was sleeping on the bed before burning her. "Her flat was also burnt and firefighters extinguished the fire," Mbele added. Dalingozi succumbed to her injuries in hospital later that day. Thobane fled to Limpopo following the incident, but was nabbed on Tuesday in Mokopane.
