Johannesburg - The 27-year-old Zimbabwean national accused of being one of the people who murdered a Vlakfontein family of seven now wants to apply for bail after abandoning it last week. Ernest Mabaso's lawyer William Sekgatja dropped the bombshell on Monday morning at the Lenasia Magistrates' court. The matter was in court to allow Mabaso's co-accused,  Fifita Khupe, 61, to make a formal bail application. The two men face seven counts of murder each. Allegations are that they killed seven family members; three adults and four children, the youngest of whom was a 2-year-old boy, and then buried the bodies inside their house. A family member also confirmed to The Star that Khupe had been in a 15-year relationship with one of the deceased. Mabaso also faces three counts of rape. Mabaso fled Gauteng after the murders and was nabbed in Limpopo. When they appeared for the first time in court last week Monday, Mabaso stated that he would not be applying for bail. Khupe, on the other hand, said he would be bringing forward a formal bail application. However, on the day that Khupe was to apply for bail, Mabaso also went to court and that's where Sekgatja revealed that his client had changed his mind and would also be applying for bail. The matter has since been postponed to November 20 where the two would both be applying for bail. The Star
