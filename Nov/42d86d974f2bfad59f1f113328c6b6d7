THE 27-year-old man accused of dousing Viwe Dalingozi, his girlfriend, with petrol and setting her alight in downtown Joburg was due to appear in court today. Captain Xoli Mbele said the accused will make his first appearance in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court after being arrested in Mokopane, Limpopo. “He had fled to Limpopo, but the law caught up with him,” said Mbele. Dalingozi, 31, succumbed to her burn wounds at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital on Sunday. The accused allegedly set Dalingozi on fire at their Joburg CBD flat early on Friday morning. Police revealed that the pair had an argument before Dalingozi was doused with petrol. Initial reports suggested that after discovering that Dalingozi had been in touch with her former lover, the new boyfriend flew into a rage and attacked her. Reacting to the death, Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane had said: "Incidents of this nature have become a regular occurrence and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. I am outraged by the senseless killing of Viwe Dalingozi by her alleged boyfriend," she had said on Wednesday before the man was arrested.
