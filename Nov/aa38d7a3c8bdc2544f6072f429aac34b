A woman who was allegedly raped and impregnated twice by her father finally broke her silence, leading to his arrest in their Lenasia home in the south of Joburg. The man, who allegedly is the father of two of his daughter’s children, spent his 10th night in custody yesterday after his bail hearing was postponed during a dramatic day at the Protea Regional Court. The 53-year-old man was arrested on November 5 after his daughter, 32, broke her silence and reported the matter to local police. The woman raised eyebrows when, inside the courtroom, she was seen casually speaking to her alleged tormentor, who sat in the dock. Lenasia police spokesperson Captain Mbulaheni Netshivhodza told a local newspaper that the “monster dad” was arrested after he arrived home on November 5 and accused his daughter of being unfaithful to him and physically assaulted her. Netshivhodza said the man moved to Gauteng with his wife and daughter in 1999. In 2010, they moved to Lenasia. The incestuous abuse allegedly started shortly after the death of the man’s wife in 2003. The Star
