Johannesburg - Four people, including a well-known former soccer player and analyst were to appear at the Randfontein Magistrateâ€™s Court on Friday on charges of manufacturing and dealing in drugs. The suspects were arrested on Wednesday following the discovery of a clandestine drug laboratory on the man's smallholding in Randfontein. This follows an investigation by a multi-disciplinary team made up of crime intelligence, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) and Gauteng Province Anti-Gang Unit members. The soccer legend, whose identity is known to The Star but cannot be revealed before he appears in court, played for Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows in his heyday. He had also been a soccer analyst for years. Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said before arresting the four men, the multi-disciplinary team had been observing the small holding for a period of time until they were satisfied that they had enough evidence to apply for a search warrant. The search warrant, she said, was effected in the early hours of Wednesday morning. She said upon their arrival at the smallholding, they discovered chemicals and machines used to manufacture mandrax as well as a truck containing liquid chemicals. The Star
