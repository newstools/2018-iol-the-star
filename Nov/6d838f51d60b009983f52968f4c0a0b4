Johannesburg - Lerato Sengadi has put a spanner in the works regarding late hip-hop star Jabulani "HHP" Tsambo's death by filing an urgent court application, barring his parents from burying him. Tsambo, who died on October 23, was to be buried on Saturday in Mahikeng. However, in papers that were recently filed, Sengadi says she is Tsambo's customary wife, after a union they entered into on February 28, 2016. She said that this makes her Tsambo's lawful wife. "The respondent  (Robert Tsambo) and/or those acting in his instruction is ordered the forthwith provide to the applicant full details regarding the whereabouts of the remains of the deceased. "The respondent and or any person acting under his instructions is interdicted and restrained from making or proceeding with any further funeral arrangement's for the burial of the deceased; releasing the remains of the deceased to any person other than the applicant and burying the deceased. This comes in the wake of Tsambo's family recently releasing a statement saying Sengadi was not Tsambo's widow. A few days ago family spokesperson Nkululeko Ncana had said: "I would like to put this matter to rest and categorically state on record that Ms Sengadi is not, and was never married to Jabulani. She is not his wife! "Ms Sengadi is Jabu's ex-fiancée and moved out of his home and his life on her own accord last year. She and her mother were requested to desist from spreading this falsehood. "As things stand, the Tsambo family reserves its rights should Ms Sengadi continue to peddle these falsehoods." The Star
