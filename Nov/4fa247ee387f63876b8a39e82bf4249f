The City of Ekurhuleni is embarking on a city-wide disconnection drive of illegal electricity connections and arresting suspected syndicates after losing close to R800 million a year due to illegal power connections. Close to 30 people believed to have illegally tampered with electrical infrastructure have been arrested in November alone. Spokesman for the City of Ekurhuleni, Themba Gadebe, said the City has now resorted to use a harsher possible criminal justice process by using the new legislative framework (Criminal Matters Amendment Act No 18 of 2015). "Initially, people accused of tampering with electrical equipment could be released on bail by a police officer or a prosecutor as the crime was deemed a minor offence. The amended legislation provides that bail for persons accused of crimes related to essential infrastructure, such as water and electricity installations, may only be considered by a court, not police officers or prosecutors. The legislation has also provided for harsher minimum sentences ranging from 3 years to 7 years for some of essential infrastructure crimes, and regulated theft of ferrous or non-ferrous metal which formed part of essential infrastructure. "Municipal officials, contractors and companies that connect illegally to the power grid will face the harshest offences created by the legislation," Radebe said. Member of the Mayoral Committee for Water, Sanitation and Energy, Tiisetso Nketle said the City has adopted a hard-line approach to illegal power connections. “In addition to the use of the criminal justice system to curb illegal connections, customers who are found to have connected illegally will face a back-billing from the day they stopped purchasing electricity,” Nketle said. Businesses that are found to have connected themselves illegally face having to pay as much as R90 000 for a re-connection.
