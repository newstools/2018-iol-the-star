It has been a year since The #NoExcuse movement was launched by Black Label  with the aim of telling men that alcohol is not an excuse to abuse their partners and children. To date, the programme has reached over 5000 men in Gauteng and Western Cape and plans are underway to expand it through the remaining seven provinces. Various prominent male celebrities like DJ Fresh, Robert Marawa and Matthew Booth came on board by sharing their stories pertaining to Gender Based Violence. Speaking at the launch on Thursday, Craig Wilkinson, founder of organisation Father A Nation said men were the only solution to this on going issue. "No man is born an abuser, something happens along their journey that changes them. If we can heal men, we can heal the nation," he said. According to him, being a man was either a blessing or curse and this element needed to be channeled correctly. He said the #NoExcuse problem had three target areas that  would build men into men of influence. The target areas, he said, were  local football associations, Further Education and Training Colleges and taverns. He said the they would use the social areas to influence, teach and change the perceptions of men.
