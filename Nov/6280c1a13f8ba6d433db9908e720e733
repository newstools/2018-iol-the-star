A Cholera outbreak has been recorded in Limpopo, forcing the government to take vigilant action to stop a possible spread. The outbreak is suspected to have been triggered by a Zimbabwean farmworker who lives in Alldays, Blouburg, in Limpopo. The man is believed to have visited Zimbabwe two weeks before he fell sick on his return. He had suffered acute diarrhoea and vomiting before he checked himself in at Alldays Clinic, said provincial Health Department spokesperson Neil Shikwambani. The patient has since been transferred to Helena Franz Hospital. Shiwambani said the department has urged people to be vigilant and practice proper hygiene and sanitation practices. He further said they have already activated the district outbreak response team to conduct further investigation at the farm and possible risk areas. It has been found that the outbreak of cholera in Zimbabwe was in parts of the city where many water pipes are damaged and where broken sewerage systems have been in urgent need of repair for more than a decade. The pipes in one of the worst affected suburbs, Budiriro, are said to be still broken, resulting in resident not having piped water in their homes. Many were forced to use water from small wells they have dug in their small gardens. That water was found to be infected with sewage from leaking underground pipes. Ten years ago,Â  4000 people died of the cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe and about 100 000 were infected. Health-e News
