To commemorate this huge milestone, more than 500 firefighters from all the provinces gathered outside Hekpoort, Magaliesberg, to take part in the Azishe Sport Games for four days. Activities included soccer, archery, golf, running, push-ups and sit-ups. Akhona Mlindazwe, from the Eastern Cape, scooped the title of Toughest Female Fighter. She said she was grateful for the initiative as it was her “shot at a better life”, especially because she did not have a matric qualification. “The job we do is extremely dangerous. You need to be strong because of the dangerous environment and the pressured circumstances we have to endure. Fitness is key. I am also grateful to Working on Fire because I was unemployed and struggled for most of my life,” said the 32-year-old. The programme employs 30% females in its ranks of firefighters, the highest level of female participation in any firefighting service in the world. Nceba Ngcobo, director at the Department of Environmental Affairs, encouraged them to continue doing the outstanding work as it was “not for the faint-hearted”. “We will continue to support this life-changing initiative. We’ll make sure the legacy continues.” The initiative was also lauded by Stanley Henderson, the deputy director-general of the Department of Public Works. “I feel extremely honoured to be part of this initiative, especially in its 15-year milestone. I speak with humility. What you are doing is very brave. Keep up the good work,” he said. Absa donated R100 000 to Working on Fire. Ronnie Mbatsane, managing executive for the KwaZulu-Natal region, said: “We really appreciate the job you do. This donation is a token of our appreciation and our way of showing that you matter.”
