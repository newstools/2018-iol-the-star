The Hague, Netherlands: The newly elected vice-president of Crime Stoppers International and well-known anti-crime activist, Yusuf Abramjee, says “the time has come for the world to stand united and say NO to crime”. Abramjee says the levels of crime in many parts of the globe are “unacceptably high and global partnerships need to be formed to fight the scourge”. He says “we in South Africa are sick and tired of crime and the blood, bullets and bodies” must be stopped. At its 39th annual conference, Crime Stoppers International (CSI) announced that Sharon Hanlon, director from Region Five (Australia/New Zealand/Southeast Asia) and Abramjee, one of the directors for Region Seven (South Africa), had been elected president and vice-president to lead CSI.  In the 40 years since Crime Stoppers began, this is the first time a woman has served as president. Abramjee is the head of #MakeSASafe, chief ambassador of the Namola/DialDirect Safety App and spokesperson for the #TaxBackBack campaign. As a former teacher, crime reporter, crime editor, news editor, station manager, head of news and media executive, Abramjee has earned multiple awards for his tireless efforts to empower the citizens of South Africa to report criminal behaviour, journalism, leadership and community activism. He received a National Order from the South African government in 2014. Abramjee’s penchant for engaging the public and exposing criminal activity will help CSI further its goals. “Fighting crime and creating a safer world has been and will always be close to my heart,” said Abramjee. “I fully understand the importance of communicating, networking, alliances and partnerships and making a difference. I look forward to serving CSI and our delegates in this new leadership role. "I thank CSI directors and members for the confidence they have in me. I am humbled and honoured to be elected vice-president,” Abramjee told The Star. The Star
