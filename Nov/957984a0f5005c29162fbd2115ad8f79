Gift Mokoena, the 29-year-old Soweto man who raped and robbed several women in a moving taxi, will be jailed for many years for his heinous crimes. On Thursday, Acting Judge Cassim Moosa handed him 13 life sentences for each rape he committed in the Toyota Quantum he was hired to drive and a further 340 years for counts including aggravated robbery, kidnapping and pointing his female victims with what resembled a gun. The sentences, delivered at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court, will run concurrently. “The accused is effectively sentenced to life imprisonment,” said Moosa. Standing in the dock, the father-of-three appeared unfazed by this sentence. He reacted angrily to a journalist who asked him after sentencing if he had anything to say. One of his victims could not hold back tears when Judge Moosa read his sentencing ruling. During the trial, Mokoena pleaded guilty to all 50 counts the National Prosecuting Authority had pursued against him after DNA had linked to all the rapes. His victims had also pointed him out during an identity parade. Mokoena's crimes date back to September 2016 but was only arrested late last year. Judge Moosa said the court needed to send a clear and strong message to society that those guilty of raping women and children would be jailed for a long time. Mokoena targeted defenceless women in his clearly planned rapes, the Judge pointed out. The women believed they were boarding a genuine taxi in areas such as Soweto, Rosebank and Freedom Park. Judge Moosa said it was deplorable that rape, a most “denigrating” crime had become a nightmare for society. “I'm of the view that this systemic disease needs to be quashed,” he said. The government has identified violence against women and children as a scourge, Judge Moosa pointed out. “The clarion call that needs to be reverberated by this court is hashtag enough is enough, hashtag sekwanele,” the Judge said
