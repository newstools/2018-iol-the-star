Award winning Nigeria Poet, Titilope Sonuga added Johannesburg to her highly anticipated Open Tour which  includes Edmonton, Calgary, London, Lagos and Abuja. Spoken word and literature enthusiasts will get an early festive season gift on December 11 when the poetry and music event kicks off at the revered Space.Com theatre at the Joburg Theatre Complex, Braamfontein with limited tickets selling at R150. “Open is a meditation on surrender through poetry and music. It is a journey of truth-telling as a pathway to healing and gratitude as a vehicle for joy,” she said.  “How do we open our hands to let go of what does not belong to us and receive what was always ours? How do we remain true? In Johannesburg we will affirm love, we insist that we are still here and we are still OPEN,” said Sonuga. She is the winner of the 2011 Canadian Authors’ Association Emerging Writer Award for her first collection of poems, Down To Earth. Her second collection Abscess was published in 2014 by Geko Publishing (South Africa). Her work has appeared in Brittle Paper, The Great Black North: Contemporary African Canadian Poetry, was translated into Italian for El-Ghibli Magazine, and into German for the Berlin International Poetry Festival.  She is the recipient of the 2018 Edmonton Arts Council Large Project Grant to produce her next spoken word album “Swim”. Her collection of poetry, This Is How We Disappear, is forthcoming with Write Bloody North in the spring of 2019.   The Titilope Open Joburg Tour is delivered in partnership with the Word N Sound Live Literature Company with support from Current State of Poetry and the Joburg Theatre. Doors will open at 7pm with the show starting at 8pm.
