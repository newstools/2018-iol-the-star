The band has since scooped three South African Music Awards and gained global popularity. The members consist of Dr Duda (producer, DJ and keyboardist), Mo-T (trumpeter) and J’ Something (vocalist) and have taken the country by storm with their jazz and house blend. The festival is set to take place this Saturday in Boksburg. J’Something said the audience could expect an unforgettable evening, which would include new music and a captivating and heartfelt performance as they always deliver. “We have a history with the venue (Birchwood) and it is always special. We love performing everywhere, in fact, so this event is merely a platform for us to do what we love. We always bring energy and a good time and vibes,” he said. He also said that next month would be filled with ample festivities and the band would be performing in Mozambique, Botswana and Cape Town. Afro-pop sensation Encore, comedian Nina Hastie and rising star Samu will also make appearances on the night. Both Mi Casa and Encore performed at the Standard Bank Joy of Jazz in 2009 and 2012, and the Capital Arts Festival in 2010. The Tswana group has been topping the local charts for many years. Up-and-coming songstress Samu (Portia Nkuna) will open the evening with her soulful jazz sounds. She first made her mark on the local music scene with her single Dream On this year, and describes her musical inspiration as capturing the spirit of ubuntu and introspection. Renowned comedienne and MC Nina Hastie will take over the stage with her distinct style of controversial comedy. Tickets are R4500 for a table of 10 or R450 per person, including a three-course buffet, table, wine and a night of iconic local entertainment.
