Johannesburg- Football legend Mike “Sporo” Mangena has been granted R50 000 bail. However, bail was denied to his three co-accused because they are illegal immigrants. Morena Maqoaelane, William Kazipota and Kennedy Tsogalane will be behind bars until their trial starts in February next year. Mangena and his three co-accused had made a brief appearance at the Randfontein Magistrate's Court on Monday morning on charges of manufacturing and dealing in drugs. Members of the Hawks and Gauteng Province Anti-Gang arrested the four last week on grounds that they manufactured mandrax at a farm outside Randfontein. The farm belongs to the 60-year-old Mangena, famed for playing professional football in his youth. He played for Kaizer Chiefs, among other teams in his heyday. Mangena was also a soccer commentator for SABC for a long time and is also in the estate business. Announcing the arrests last week, police said their multi-disciplinary team had observed the small holding for a period of time until they were satisfied that they had enough evidence to apply for a search warrant. During the raid, the police said they discovered a steel shed full of chemicals and machines used to manufacture mandrax as well as a truck containing liquid chemical. The Star
