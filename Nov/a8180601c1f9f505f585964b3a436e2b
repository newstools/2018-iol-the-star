Heartbreaking scenes of an 8-year-old breaking down on the stand after detailing the trauma of being allegedly sexually abused played out in court as the trial of the Soweto school patroller continued. The schoolgirl said Johannes Molefe, 58, touched her buttocks last year after he had sent her and her friends to his quarters to fetch him a plate. She was testifying on Thursday at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court, Molefe is facing three rape counts and 11 of sexual assault for allegedly violating primary school girls aged between 5 and 13 last year. The rape accused has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and his lawyer, Advocate Lumka Qoqo said her client will deny all allegations against him. Qoqo also said that "there was so much coaching involved in this case" implying that the counselling the girls received from the Teddy Bear Clinic, among others, where the girls had to give their versions of the alleged abuse, was tantamount to being coached to testify against her client. Repeated aggressive cross-examination questions to the girl, who was testifying through a court-appointed intermediary in order to protect her against undue trauma, caused her to breakdown on the stand. The child, however, said she was strong enough to continue with her testimony, which concluded shortly before lunchtime. Court adjourned shortly afterwards andÂ  the trial was expected to continue on Monday. @khayakoko88
