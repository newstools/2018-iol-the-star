An additional 22 will be added to the operational fleet from mid-January 2019. All buses will be universally accessible and will cater to passengers with special needs. ThroughoutÂ  November, the service will be extended by the addition of a complimentary route that will operate from the terminus at Tembisa Hospital with curbside stops all the way to OR Tambo International Airport. The route will consist of 28km in one direction, and a 56km round trip. Services will commence at 3.45am with a bus leaving Tembisa Hospital to the OR Tambo Airport. There will be no services over weekends and public holidays, and a R13 flat fare will be charged to utilise the system. A cashless Harambee Europay Mastercard and Visa (EMV) card will be introduced as a reloadable bus ticket. The city will be piloting the service during this month, thereafter commuters will be given a period to migrate from the fare collection system. Seven new ticket sales points will be available at Tembisa Hospital, Rabasotho Hall, Kempton Park Civic Centre, OR Tambo Airport, the corner of Andrew Mapetho and Dan Nkabinde drives, and two branded Harambee mobile kiosks will move around the city.
