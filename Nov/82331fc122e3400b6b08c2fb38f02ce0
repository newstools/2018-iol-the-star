The North West Secondary School for the Deaf in Leeudoringstad near Wolmaranstad has 84 pupils. The school was re-opened after a fire at the hostel claimed the lives of three pupils in 2014. The SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) earlier this year blamed education officials for the deaths of the pupils at the school. The commission in February said department officials were responsible for the deaths of the girls at the hostel. “The commission finds that the respondents (North West School of the Deaf, the head of department at North West Education, the MEC for education and the minister of basic education) failed to comply with legislation and policy, including the national building standards, regulations and national norms and standards, regulations for safety measures at public schools and uniform norms and standards of the Department of Public Works disability policy guidelines,” it said in a statement. Premier of the North West Province, Professor Tebogo Job Mokgoro, said the school renovations had cost R127 million and improved the safety and security of pupils with special needs. “In a concerted effort to prevent the recurrence of unpleasant events similar to the 2015 fire incident, the provincial government prioritised the installation of fire suppression facilities which include hi-tech smoke detectors in all buildings, bed-shakers on all beds and emergency flashing lights in all school buildings, among others,” Mokgoro said.
