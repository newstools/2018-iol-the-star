“Hurt people hurt people”, the official data released in June has further confirmed. It reveals that crimes against women and children have increased over the past two years. In line with International Men's Day yesterday, a panel discussion of five accomplished men from diverse industries took place.  The conversation was facilitated by media personality Masechaba Ndlovu, and the panel consisted of award-winning actor Pallance Dladla, sports broadcaster Robert Marawa, internationally acclaimed comedian Donovan Goliath and political analyst Eusebius McKaiser. The conversation was influenced by a Black Label beer commercial launched in September. The advert asks: “Be a man. What does that mean?” and challenges men to be “bold”, “brave” and “strong” by allowing themselves to be vulnerable and fragile. Dladla said one of the biggest challenges about being a person of colour was that you don't know you're depressed and are exposed to too much from an early age. Also, therapy was expensive and was seen as a taboo in the black community. “Your parents say to you ‘you ate and you are full. What more do you want? Your neighbours are starving - you should be grateful,” he said. According to Goliath, who was diagnosed with depression three years ago, a major difficulty, especially as an artist, was that one often became immune to stress because of the fast paced and unstable environment. “Your boss is constantly looking to you for fresh ideas. It doesn't matter if you've had a death in your family or a relative is ill; you have to make a plan and deliver.”  He said people of colour find out about therapy late in life, when most of the psychological and emotional damage was at its peak.
