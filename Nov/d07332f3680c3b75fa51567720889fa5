Johannesburg - A 58-year-old Soweto school patroller allegedly touched their private parts and penetrated them with his fingers. These details emerged on Wednesday at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court as prosecutor Advocate Jackie Steyn read out the 14 charges against former school patroller Johannes Molefe. The charges include three counts of rape and 11 of sexual assault on 13 girls who were aged between 5 and 13 at the time of the acts. The crimes, according to the State, occurred last year while Molefe was working at the school. Molefe stated that he would plead not guilty to all 14 charges. However, he admitted to the evidence from the forensic reports that were conducted by health workers who had examined the children after they were allegedly violated. While the State will rely on these reports to prove it's case, Molefe has maintained his innocence, saying even though the forensics are correct, he did not sexually assault or rape any child. The State made an uncontested application for the children to testify through the use of a qualified intermediary and also in a Private Testifying Room so that they don't have to face their alleged abuser. Their testimoniesÂ will be conveyed through a TV screen inside the courtroom. Acting Judge Peet Johnson granted the intermediary application and the State was to call its first witness shortly before the lunch interval. The trial continues. @khayakoko88 The Star
