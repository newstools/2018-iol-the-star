Kwaito legends Trompies are planning a performance of a lifetime as one of the main acts for the creative gathering One Source Live.  Group member Eugene Mthethwa says Trompies is happy to be part of something that celebrates African creativity. “Moreover, the genre we come from is original and unique to South Africa. I think that's why the organisers involved us.” Mthethwa said Trompies had yet to receive a negative review for their music. “We cut across the youth because they do love our music. I don't know how it happens because the airwaves don't play much of our songs but I know when we play Sweety Lavo, for instance, everybody stands up and dances to that music."People coming to these events and supporting them is a beacon of hope for us as we have stayed true to our cultures,” said Mthethwa. One Source Live will have performances from SJava, Shane Eagle, DJ PH, Nigerian musical sensation D’BANJ and the leaders of the Gqom nation, Distruction Boyz. Taking place at 1 Fox in Joburg later this month, the event will once again feature creative revolutionaries Khuli Chana, Sho Madjozi, Trevor Stuurman and Osborne Macharia. The Star
