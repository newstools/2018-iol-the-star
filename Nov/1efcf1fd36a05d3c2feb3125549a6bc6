This follows a slew of written complaints to the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities from mainly Christian groups and worshippers, who were angered by “not having a choice” in eating Halaal-certified products. “As a Christian believer, I’m forced to buy products from a culture group that makes up only 2.6% of our population. I therefore have to finance a system that I do not support and I also do not know how the money is spent,” one of the submitted complaints said, according to a City Press report earlier this year. However, SA National Halaal Authority’s (Sanha) leader MS Navlakhi dismissed the views as coming from pedlars of “fake news and bitterness”. There is an anti-Halaal Facebook page, with more than 1200 followers, which circulates videos and alleged “proof” of how money garnered from certification is taken outside the country to fund so-called Islamic terrorism. The commission confirmed it received “a number of complaints about the issue of the seals or stamps on foods such as Halaal, Kosher (Judaism), Aum (Hinduism) and others”. Sanha’s annual report last year showed the organisation made just more than R1million from issuing licence fees to certified manufacturers. Navlakhi said this money was used to pay for supervision of processes in Halaal-certified food products and outlets, among other things. “Our organisation is non-profit and we do not fund any international organisation. There isn’t a cent which goes beyond our borders - let alone (other) Muslim countries or terrorist organisations,” Navlakhi said. He said the CRL Rights Commission had an integral role in dispelling “fake news and bitterness”, which he said was peddled by anti-Muslim sentiments. The Star
