Ninow, who was making his third appearance in court, faces charges of rape, possession of drugs, assault with intent to do bodily harm and intimidation. He allegedly followed the girl from the restaurant’s play area to the toilets, where he allegedly raped her. The girl’s mother caught him in the act after she went looking for her child. The court has heard that Ninow has mental issues, and has previously attempted suicide several times due to depression caused by bipolar disorder.     The defence, led by Legal Aid attorney Riaan du Plessis, requested three clinical psychologists be appointed to assess Ninow, instead of the usual two. The defence also told Magistrate Thandi Theledi that Ninow has a history of substance abuse, which started when he was 14 years old. The matter will be back in court on November 28. Streets around court were cordoned off yesterday as political party activists and civil society organisations’ members were protesting, demanding Ninow be denied bail. ANA
