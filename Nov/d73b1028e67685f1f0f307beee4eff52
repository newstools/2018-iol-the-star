His daughter Ayanda Moyo, 20, said despite it being only a few weeks since her father's passing, the education fund would lighten their burden of trying to cope with their loss. “We are very grateful for the fund. I did not understand the magnitude of the relationship my dad had with the Jewish people but this (fund) is evidence of the impact he made in their lives. I am delighted that my siblings and I will never have to struggle to go to school,” she said. Moyo is survived by his wife and four children aged 10 months, seven years, 12 and Ayanda. She is currently studying towards a Bachelor of Pharmacy Degree at Wits University. The fund is a gift from various communities such as the SA Friends of Israel (Safi), the SA Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD), the South African Zionist Federation (SAZF) and other organisations to thank and pay tribute to the Moyo family for Moses’s relentless and unwavering spirit in the journalistic field. Wendy Kahn, national director of the SAJBD, described him as a great friend of the South African Jewish family and someone whose unrelenting energy, political acumen and strategic vision had brought a new dimension to the ongoing battle against anti-Israel prejudice and disinformation in South African society. Ben Swartz, SAZF national chairperson, commended Moyo for his bravery and resilience when confronting the enemies of Israel in South Africa.
