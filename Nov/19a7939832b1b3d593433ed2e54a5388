"Anxious" children who were allegedly raped and sexually assaulted at a Soweto primary school by a patroller will have to wait a few more days for the trial's start due to a clogged court roll. The case was supposed to have started on Monday at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court. However, state prosecutor Advocate Jackie Steyn asked for a postponement to Wednesday as the courtroom where the case was to be heard had another matter on the roll. Acting Judge Peet Johnson granted the postponement. Johannes Molefe, 58, is facing three rape counts and 11 of sexual assault for allegedly violating girls as young as 6-years-old at a the primary school where he was employed as a patroller. He was arrested in October last year after several parents blew the whistle on him following a school trip where he allegedly brushed the buttocks of an 11-year-old girl and telling her he wished she was his girlfriend. Speaking outside the court on behalf of the parents, community leader Phindile Singe said the children were anxious for the matter to conclude, but that they were doing well considering the alleged ordeal they had to endure. Singe said parents were worried that the case would not go ahead as there were issues which almost hindered it. However, she refused to be drawn into revealing what those hindrances were. It was a packed courtroom on Monday as Molefe made his first trial appearance, with dozens of family and community members pleading for their children to get justice. A  clean shaven Molefe said said he understood why the case had to be postponed. He declined bail, and will remain in custody until his trial concludes. @khayakoko88
