Molefe is facing three charges of rape and 11 of sexual assault, which he allegedly committed in 2017. The girl said she reported the incidents to her teacher who, in turn, told her to tell the principal, Maria Mthimkhulu. The 10-year-old said the principal asked teachers to gather all the children, who complained they had been assaulted by Molefe, in the computer room. Defence lawyer Lumka Xoxo tried to point out contradictions in the child’s testimony, saying her friend told the court earlier that she did not see Molefe touching her breast and that the incident happened inside the guard room and not at the back of it. Xoxo put it to the girl that the accused, who the schoolchildren referred to as “Mkhulu”, was denying allegations that he fondled their breasts and private parts “I am saying Mkhulu is lying, he can even ask the whole school,” retorted the 10-year-old. The trial continues. African News Agency (ANA)
