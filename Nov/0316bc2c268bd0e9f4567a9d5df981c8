The television actor - popularly known as Tau Mogale - failed to submit his income tax returns from 2013 to last year. The South African Revenue Service (Sars) says Seiphemo owes more than R48 000 in unpaid tax. During TUesday's proceedings at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court, State prosecutor Duduzile Robertse revealed that there were ongoing engagements with the defence regarding an admission of guilt fine. The matter was postponed to November 28. During his first appearance in court on October 18, Seiphemoâ€™s legal team said that they needed time to engage with Sars and make arrangements pertaining to his tax troubles. His team also apologised to the court, saying that they had tried in vain to make amends. Meanwhile, radio and television personality Bonang Matheba is also expected to appear in the same court on Wednesday, also on charges of tax violation. Robertse is prosecuting both cases.
