LIMPOPO - Limpopo police have launched a massive manhunt for a group of about five armed suspects alleged to have shot two doctors and stabbed one at Letaba Hospital in Tzaneen. The gang is alleged to have broken into the doctors’ residence in the early hours of Thursday morning. Police said the incident occurred round 3.15am when the robbers broke into the room of a couple who were asleep. They allegedly attacked the couple, shot the man and fled with a TV and cellphones. They are said to have proceeded to another residence where another couple was asleep. There, a male doctor was shot and his wife was assaulted and stabbed with a sharp object. The robbers allegedly made off with another TV set, cellphones, a laptop, tablet and some money. The three injured victims were admitted to the hospital where they are recovering. Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has established a task team led by a Major General to hunt down the robbers. “I call on our communities to work with the police to ensure a speedy detection to this heinous crime,” said General Ledwaba. MEC for Health in Limpopo, Phophi Ramathuba, visited the hospital shortly after the shooting. “We are worried about the attack on the health care system because it is very clear that not only doctors, but all our other health care professionals are worried now,” she said. Treatment Action Campaign in Limpopo has called called for the maximisation of security levels in the health facilities. “We call upon the MEC of Health in Limpopo to ensure that the security service providers in public health care institutions are capable of delivering maximum protection to both employees and patients at all health facilities and properties,” the organisation said in a statement.
