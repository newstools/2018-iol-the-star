The Canyon Coal opened its Khanye Colliery with a blast, following a detonation procedure led by Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe, in Bronkhorstspruit last week. The mine's spokesperson Neslihan Er Ogur said the establishment of the mine created 316 full-time jobs and 194 temporary opportunities during the construction phase. “When the mine is in full production, a total of 316 people will be employed on a full-time basis. These numbers include the two plants, the mining employees, weighbridge and stockyard, laboratory, office and support personnel. “The mine is also involved in enterprise development, in order to develop small and medium enterprises to start up and develop sustainable businesses,” Ogur said. “The mine procures goods and services on a preferential basis from the local providers and only procure from outside if the local businesses cannot provide the required goods and services,” she said. At the opening of the mine, Mantashe said: “We have to produce optimally. We have resources we are not using, mines that are not being mined. We must improve productivity. That's why I'm excited by the presentation about your plans.” Canyon director Rudzani Mudogwa, whose company Kalyana Resources is an empowerment partner, provided a high-level presentation about Canyon's plans, including Khanye operations. Khanye has reserves of about 39million tons, with an estimated life span of 15 years. Canyon is also completing a processing plant on the mine.
