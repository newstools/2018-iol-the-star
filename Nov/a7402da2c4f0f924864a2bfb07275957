On Thursday, Phamotse evealed the cover of the new book, I tweet what I like So sue me! In it, Phamotse talks about being gagged on social media and her experience following a court battle with celebrity couple Basetsana and Romeo Kumalo after a series of tweets claiming there was “a sex tape involving the husband of a well-known media mogul with a younger rapper”. The couple took her to court and she was ordered her not to make comments on the couple on social media in the future. However, this has not deterred Phamotse. In the past three months, she has penned a book on the court case. “I am tired of people using their power to manipulate the system. My mission is simple: I want everyone to get a voice, stand up and take back your power,” she said. Asked whether she was concerned about the legal implications, Phamotse said: “I am not supposed to say anything. I am not supposed to write anything on social media but this (pointing at the book cover) is my answer.” Wikus Steyl, of Ian Levitt Attorneys, said they were aware of Phamotse's new book. “There were four orders. Jackie can’t harass our client or make mention of our client on social media. She hasn’t breached that. “If the book concerns our client’s names, that will be in breach and we will proceed with the legal process.” The book will be available for pre-order from December 1. @SthembisoMedia
