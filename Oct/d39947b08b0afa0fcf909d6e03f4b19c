The launch at the Kyalami Conference Centre saw scores of excited Huawei brand consumers gather to catch a peek of the new device. Without a doubt, Huawei will disrupt the smartphone industry with this new innovative phone range. Many have described the Mate 20 Pro as the 'king of smartphones', with a monstrous performance and ultrawide-angle triple camera that will blow your mind. Speaking at the launch, Huawei Consumer Business Group South Africa's chief technology officer, Akhram Mohamed, revealed that, besides a host of great features, the device has a longer battery life. “The Huawei Mate 20 series offers consumers a compelling combination of powerful artificial intelligence (AI), flagship performance, longer battery life, advanced security, a greater videography and photography experience, and much more, all wrapped in a sophisticated design. “It is the ultimate device made for those who will not settle for anything less than perfection,” Mohamed said. The device was officially launched in London last week. The company also announced that the first 500 customers to pre- order the phone will get a Huawei Watch GT Classic and Sport free of charge. The device is expected to be in South Africa from November 1 - priced at R18999.
