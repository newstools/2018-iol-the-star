Johannesburg- Wine connoisseurs, lovers and makers gathered at the Wanderers Club at the weekend to get a taste of the top 40 wine estates from Stellenbosch. Western Cape’s Stellenbosch was the first wine region to establish a wine route in 1971. The route is a network of over 150 wineries that offer experiences to tourists and wine lovers.      With five sub-routes and being part of the Cape Winelands, the Stellenbosch Wine Routes is a popular tourist attraction in the country. Over the last three days estates from Great Simonsberg, Helderberg, Bottelary Hills, Stellenbosch Berg and Stellenbosch Valley showcased their best blends and red and white types for the first time in Johannesburg at the Stellenbosch Wine Live in Joburg. Many of the vendors even ran out of stock as people continued to buy their favourite wines from the array of taste stations available. There was also special wine tasting rooms for a more cultured tasting for those in attendance. Presented by Pick n Pay, the affair was a lifestyle friendly day filled with good food and live entertainment from Kaya FM. Wine lover Tammy Ngcobo said she was excited to see what new red wines she could taste on her adventurous palette. “I love a good red. I am a merlot and pinotage girl and have already tasted some amazing wines from the different stations here. There are a few sparklings I have also picked out for a girls get together soon.” Events planner Caren Adams said she was on the hunt for great packages for an upcoming bridal shower she was planning. “I know I’m guaranteed great prices here, so I’m on the lookout for a good wine with good bargains. Women love their wine and for this shower, I am looking to treat the ladies to a pink affair with some really good bubbles.”
