The killers of two security guards who were shot dead while in their vehicle have not been arrested yet despite picture circulating onÂ  social media saying two people are behind bars. A picture has been doing the rounds on social media showing two police officers on the roof of a house with a man lying at their feet with his hands tied behind his back. People were quick to say that the officers had arrested the killers of the two security guards. However, Gauteng police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini denied that claim and said no one had been arrested yet. "We are aware of false pictures circulating on social media of what seems to be an arrest of the suspect. That photo is of a different incident that happened in Honeydew. We are still investigating a case of double murder and armed robbery," he said. The two security guards were killed last week Wednesday as they sat in their vehicle. In the video that captured the killing, the two men are ambushed by two gunmen who open fire through the window on the driver-side window. The first guard is instantly killed and shots are again fired from the other side, hitting the passenger on the head. The two gunmen then open the doors of the vehicle and start searching the guards who are still in their uniforms and bullet-proof vests. The lifeless body of the guard who is seated on the drivers seat, is pushed out of the vehicle and one of the gunmen takes the firearm belonging to the other guard. The Star
