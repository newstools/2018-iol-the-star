Following weeks of disruption in refuse removal in Joburg, which has seen the inner-city and its suburbs overflowing with refuse, the city has announced that officials implicated in the non-renewal of tenders with subcontractors have been suspended. The city’s member of the mayoral committee for corporate and shared services Ntombi Khumalo said senior officials who were responsible for the processing of the Pikitup fleet tender, were suspended pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct. “The city’s leadership took this step after refuse removal services were disrupted two weeks ago as a result of the inadequately - managed contract. The contract relating to Pikitup’s, non-specialised, specialised and red fleet are now the subject of investigation. “Should the investigation confirm the allegations of misconduct, we will not hesitate to take appropriate action,” said Khumalo. As an interim measure, the city has appointed officials to act in these positions to ensure tenders are finalised as a matter of urgency and advertised speedily, she added. Residents have expressed anger at Pikitup services being constantly affected either through protests or negligence. Kensington resident Eddie Mkhize said: “Rubbish (is) piling up on every corner. This is attracting rats and flies. We have now resorted to paying someone to privately empty the bins, at R50 each, but there is no guarantee that this rubbish will simply be dumped illegally elsewhere,” he said. A source at Pikitup said senior managers had been warned for months about the contracts coming to an end. The Star
