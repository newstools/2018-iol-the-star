Speaking at the funeral service, the tall born-free Ogone said: “It was crazy coming up here seeing Cyril...” Mourners as well as social media users were beaming with laughter following the statement. Ramaphosa seemingly took it all in good spirits. While others took to their gadgets to slam the boy, others saw nothing wrong with the statement. On Twitter, @mutshedzi_iHUB wrote: “So people find it funny that Edna’s grandson called the President Cyril Ramaphosa by his name not even Ntate or Mr President just Cyril. We really gotta teach our kids respect. We need to go back to basics.” In response, @TS_Relow tweeted: “The kid looks well mannered and sounds very intelligent, stop drawing respect over titles.”
