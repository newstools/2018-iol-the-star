Huawei has marked the official commencement of the training of nine Kenyan students under the technology company’s Seeds for the Future programme. The ceremony was held at the Huawei Courtyard in the capital, Beijing. The students set off for two-week’s language, culture and information and communications technology training. The course is being offered by the Huawei University in Shenzhen and will focus on cutting-edge technology such as 5G, long-term evolution (LTE) and cloud computing. The students will also visit the state-of-the-art Huawei labs to get first-hand experience of the latest global technologies. The students from Huawei Kenya will be trained alongside their peers from Bolivia. Last week, the students marked memorable experiences in Beijing by visiting the Great Wall of China, the Summer Palace and the Forbidden City. They were scheduled to undertake Chinese culture lessons like Mandarin, painting at the Beijing Culture and Language University. Vincent Omuse, from the Kenyan Embassy, welcomed the opportunity. He lauded China for being on the lead in terms of ICT and development.  The Seeds for the Future, Huawei’s global corporate social responsibility flagship programme, is running in 22 countries across Africa, with the aim to expand to more countries. - CAJ New / African News Agency (ANA)
