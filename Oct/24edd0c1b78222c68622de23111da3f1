Johannesburg - ANC members from the Moses Mabhida Region in KwaZulu Natal descended onto to the party's headquarters in the Joburg CBD demanding that the current Regional Task Team (RTT) in their province  be disbanded. The members who sang and danced for hours, wanted to see Secretary General Ace Magashule, saying he needed to disband the RTT as their appointment was unconstitutional and has caused disruptions within the organisation. Despite travelling from far and hours of singing outside in the sun, no one attended to them as seniors ANC members were all allegedly attending a funeral. Sthembiso Nkuna, sub-regional Secretary of Umgeni region, said they had come to voice their concerns on the way they have been treated by their provincial government. Nkuna said that in June 2017, the Moses Mabhida region was ready to attend the regional conference. However, the conference did not take place as then Secretary General Gwede Mantashe took the decision to postpone it. "Thereafter, a decision was made that the Regional Executive Committee (REC) should be converted to a RTT. The Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) added new comrades who wished to be part of the RTT. "Since then there have been disputes and even anarchy", said Nkuna. He said a delegation was sent in order to handle these disruptions and all disputes were cleared. "A court order was granted for the regional conference to take place and for no valid reason, the conference did not take place. "The solution here is that the conference must take place and the RTT must be converted back to the REC", Nkuna said. The Star's tried to  get a comment from ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe but despite saying he would call back, he didn't and neither did he respond to a subsequent SMS. The Star
