 The Soil front-man Ntsika Ngxanga talks to journalist Sthembiso Sithole about active technology and why he doesn’t charge his smartphone overnight Sthembiso Sithole (SS): Do you use active technology? If so, what type of active technology do you use?  Ntsika Ngxanga (NN): I use my cellphone mostly to record song ideas and my calendar to constantly remind myself of my next engagement. I also use my MacBook to jot down my lyrics and record pre-productions of any new music that I am working on.  SS: Do you use technology for educational purposes?  NN: Definitely, especially for my kids, I download all these amazing educational apps on their iPads.  SS: How would you describe your relationship with social media users on Twitter?  NN: It’s very expressive in a good way, I get instant feedback on the work I put out there and it’s always honestly beautiful.  SS: How has your smartphone made life easier for you and what type of smartphone are you using?  NN: An iPhone 8 Plus, the quality of videos, I’m talking 4K resolutions that look beautiful when I document everything worth reliving. I print on wi-fi printers directly from my phone and sending large files without having to go to office.  SS: Would you say social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have changed the role of media in society? NN: Personally I’m still a huge fan of print media but I also appreciate the role that social media plays in as far as allowing a vast majority of people around the country to access news.  SS: If you could change something about a social media platform like Twitter or Instagram, what would it be?  NN: I would take out the “like” because many people continue to unfortunately use the number of likes as validation, which I think is absurd.  SS: Do you charge your phone overnight? NN: I read somewhere that it wasn’t really wise to do that. So I’ve since stopped. So I charge as soon as I come back home and yank it out when it’s bedtime.  @SthembisoMedia
