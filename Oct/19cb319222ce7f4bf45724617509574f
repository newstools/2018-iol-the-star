A "confident" Fees Must Fall activist,Mcebo Dlamini, described himself as a buffalo bull when he appeared at the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Friday ahead of the start of his trial. Dlamini, who was in high spirits describes himself as a buffalo bull. "I feel very much confident as always. I've always said that the State does not have a case against me and I still maintain that. "I am happy the trial is starting today and that there will be no postponement," he said. In 2015, Dlamini  spearheaded the fight against high university fees at Wits University. He was arrested after being accused of violating a court order, public violence and assaulting a police officer. In August, the student activist walked  56 km from Auckland Park to the Union Buildings to ask the President to pardon all the students that were involved in the movement. He wanted the president to intervene and for some sort of amnesty to be granted. He was trying to raise awareness on the difficulties of students arrested at the height of the #FeesMustFall campaign. However, president Cyril Ramaphosa was out of the country at the time. Despite Dlamini's hopes that the trial would go ahead, it was postponed to next year April.
