It was lights, camera and action as celebrities and fashionistas hit the red carpet for the opening party of South African Fashion Week. Held at The Marc in Sandton, the occasion kicked off the festivities for the week ahead. A total of 59 designers will showcase their collections as the fashion body celebrates 21 years of existence. While some looks on the carpet were questionable, others shone. Style influencer Sarah Langa Mackay was one of the women on the red carpet who dressed the part. Her golden, figure hugging gown was a Gert-Johan Coetzee creation that made her look like a princess straight out of a fairy tale. Coetzee also dressed Dr Mathew Knowles and his wife Gena in an African inspired gown and suit. The couple have been touring the country to promote Knowles' new book- The Emancipation of Slaves through Music. Another style star was K Naomi who walked the red carpet in an elegant silver grey pleated pantsuit. The off the shoulder roped sleeve gave her look a flirty feel. Ever bubbly Khanya Mkangisa knows how to dress for her petite frame. The TV presenter came dressed in a feathered Ryan Keys creation.      A face we havenâ€™t seen much of recently, Phuti Khomo came to the party dressed in a classic number from Quiteria & George. House of Luke dressed a number of celebrities on the red carpet including singers Kelly Khumalo, Cici and Londie London. The looks weren't well received on Twitter with tweeps questioning how the celebrities chose them. The opening party was hosted by Cruz Vodka and ambassador hip hop star AKA walked the red carpet in House of Ole. Choreographer Bontle Modiselle matched his look in an orange, feminine version of his mint suit. Actress Buhle Samuels went lilac in Rubicon while presenter Lunga Shabalala was ever dapper in Ephymol. The SA Fashion Week collections will be showcased from Tuesday until Saturday in Sandton. @mane_mpi
