This year will mark the fourth time the Playing For Pink Ladies Invitational Polo continues to raise funds for breast cancer awareness. “Last year’s event raised a record R130 000 for breast cancer. This year we endeavour to raise even more than that. With October being Breast Cancer Awareness Month Reach For Recovery’s Ditto Project really stood out to me,” said organiser Edith Venter. Using the Polo match as a backdrop to raise funds, Venter said it was the perfect way to combine a love for philanthropy and polo to create an event to serve as a platform to raise awareness for a disease that is most prevalent in women, but also affects a high number of men. “The Ditto project is aimed at helping women from lower income groups, who cannot afford to undergo reconstructive surgery, to be fitted with external breast prosthesis to regain their confidence and dignity after diagnosis and surgery. It helps breast cancer survivors, with no medical aid or funds and who cannot afford to undergo breast reconstructive surgery following diagnosis and mastectomy, single and or double, achieve balance and dignity.” Venter, who is the chief executive of Edith Venter Promotions said she chose to start an initiative that focused on breast cancer because it predominantly affects women and their lives. “It is more than just dealing with cancer, but it is the emotional and physical side-effects that deeply impact women and their confidence.” On Saturday, guests attending the Playing for Pink Ladies Invitational can look forward to a day of glamour and goodwill- entertainment, gourmet food, high-fashion, pampering, luxury shopping, and sportsmanship at the Inanda Club in Sandton.  @mane_mpi
