St Peterâ€™s College education psychologist Laila Jeebodh-Desai has given candidates some tips on dealing with matric stress. Try these three steps to create a positive and powerful response to your exam anxiety: Stage 1: Acceptance Try not to fight the fact that exams are around the corner, and will be a part of your academic journey to help you get to your next stage of achievement. Accepting this fact will allow you to shift your mindset to become less resentful and more accepting about your approach to the exams. Stage 2: Stop procrastinating Stop thinking about studying and get started on your prep today. Trust your instincts and study using a routine that works best for you. Some students like to work in their room, others in a library or some while listening to music. Find the one which makes you most productive, stick with it, and get started. Stage 3: Strategise It helps to be organised. Stress tends to grow in chaotic circumstances, so if you know study is required for an exam, then make a revision timetable or schedule. Timing is important. Try to give yourself enough time in your schedule to cover all the work required, and if you have already run short of time, then prioritise. Work out which are the most important topics you need to cover. Is anything compulsory? Is there anything incomplete? Is there something that you can ask your teacher to clarify? Use the opportunity to organise your schedule and make use of your time wisely. The Star
