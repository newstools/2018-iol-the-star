The Department of Basic Education said it had roped in national security services to help administer this year’s matric final exams to 796 542 full-time and part-time candidates. The department said training of invigilators and markers had been completed to ensure quality service and that papers were marked according to standardised guidelines. “The department has left no stone unturned in its bid to ensure a credible and integrous National Senior Certificate (NSC) exam. The Department of Basic Education has embarked on an intensive review of all its systems and processes and has taken cognisance of the limitations that may have presented a challenge in previous years,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. Logistics have been sorted out and exam papers were ready. The different points at which the question papers were stored en route to the school had been checked and audited. Matric learners across the country will on Friday voluntarily sign a pledge to commit to upholding the integrity of the exams by not participating in any malpractice, said the department.
