Microsoft has announced that it will re-release its Windows 10 October 2018 Update, as it has fixed the data deletion-related issues. The software giant’s John Cable, who is director of programme management for Windows servicing and delivery said: “We paused the rollout of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update (version 1809) for all users, because we investigated isolated reports of users missing files after updating. “Given the serious nature of any data loss, we took the added precaution of pulling all 1809 media across all channels, including Windows Server 2019 and IoT equivalents.” The software giant said that there were only a few reports of data loss.  “We have fully investigated all reports of data loss, identified and fixed all known issues in the update, and conducted internal validation,” Cable said. Microsoft is now re-releasing the Windows 10 October 2018 Update to Windows insiders before rolling it out more broadly to consumers. “We will carefully study the results, feedback and diagnostic data from our insiders before launching it broadly to consumers,” Cable added. “Microsoft has developed fixes to address a variety of problems related to all the issues and these fixes are now being tested with Windows insiders,” he said. “We have added an ability for users to also provide an indication of impact and severity when filing user-initiated feedback and we expect this will allow us to better monitor the most impactful issues even when feedback volume is low.” Microsoft will now monitor feedback related to this re-released build of Windows 10 October 2018 Update and will officially launch it to consumers once the company is confident about the update. “We are committed to learning from this experience and improving our processes and notification systems to help ensure that our customers have a positive experience with our update process,” Cable said.
