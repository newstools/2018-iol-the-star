Johannesburg - An alleged hijacker died inside a hijacked vehicle he was driving when it crashed into a tree while his accomplice was wounded. An off duty police officer who had witnessed the hijacking had shot at  the two before they crashed. The incident happened around 7pm on Wednesday night at the corners of Beyers Naude and Akasia Road in Fairlands. Allegations are that the two men confronted the driver of a Toyota Land Cruiser who had stopped at a pharmacy. The men, who were wearing balaclavas, allegedly pointed their firearms at the man then took his car. He was not injured in the incident. An off-duty police officer, who was also at the pharmacy, witnessed the entire hijacking and is alleged to have fired at the suspects as they drove off. However, the pair did not manage to drive far as they crashed the hijacked vehicle into a tree. The one who was driving the hijacked car died at the scene while his passenger was injured. Police also seized two handguns at the scene. SAPS spokesperson for Gauteng Province Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said it was unclear whether the victim was being followed by the pair but that as soon as he stopped at the pharmacy, they approached him and robbed him of his car. “A police officer who witnessed the robbery in process approached the two suspects who were trying to rob a victim of his Toyota Land Cruiser. The suspect crashed the car into a tree. "When police arrived there, one of the hijackers was found dead and the other was taken to hospital where he is under police guard. We will be charging the suspect with armed robbery, attempted murder, and possession of an unlicensed firearm,” he said. Dlamini also said it was not yet known whether the man died of a gunshot wound or injuries sustained after crashing into the tree. The Star
