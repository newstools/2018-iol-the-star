“We call on the JSE to provide us with a full audit of how many classified Coloureds are employed in all listed companies, and also reveal how many communities benefit from their CSI (corporate social investment) spend and programmes of development,” GSCC spokesperson Anthony William said. He added the group wanted to know how many coloured or people of mixed race held shares on the JSE. “We are giving them seven days to respond to our demands.” Marketing head of the exchange, Mpho Ledwaba, said: “The JSE has accepted the notice letter. “As per standard practice, the letter will be reviewed internally and thereafter the best course of action will be determined and actioned if and where appropriate.” The grouping claimed to represent the communities of Westbury, Eldorado Park, Kliptown, Noordgesig and Ennerdale.
