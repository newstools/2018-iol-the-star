Higher Education and Training Minister Naledi Pandor and India's High Commissioner to South Africa and Lesotho, Ruchira Kamboj, launched the Ghandi-Mandela Centre of Specialisation for Artisan Skills in Pretoria West on Monday. The centre will be based at the Tshwane South TVET College, where the launch took place during a ceremony attended by experts from South Africa and India. Company bosses were also at the launch. Some companies will partner with the project. Addressing the launch, Pandor said similar centres will be launched in other selected colleges. She said the event was a “soft” launch of the project. The “hard” launch will detail plans for apprenticeships. “We'll have a mega celebration,” Pandor said. South Africa has been criticised for the fact that it no longer offered apprenticeships to youth. The Ghandi-Mandela Centre of Specialisation for Artisan Skills will see public TVET colleges going back to offering boilermaking. Three other skills that will be imparted at the centre are electrical engineering, mechanical fitting and turning, and millwright. “The centre will promote quality vocational training in these sectors to meet the requirements of youth in South Africa,” said Kamboj. The High Commissioner said India would bear the costs of project planning, training of lecturers in India and installation of required training equipment. “After the completion and handing over of the project, its administration, running and maintenance shall be taken over by the government of South Africa,” Kamboj said. The centre follows a Memorandum of Understanding signed by President Cyril Ramaphosa and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
