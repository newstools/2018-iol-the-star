The SABC show recently reached a massive 10.2million viewers, making Uzalo the most-watched television programme by far from the public broadcaster. Cast member Khaya Dladla, who plays GC, said he was delighted about the milestone. “It’s super exciting. It is something that we wanted. It’s like when we won a Safta. Everyone is playing their role. I wake up everyday and do what I love,” Dladla said. Uzalo was voted most popular soapie by the public earlier this year at the South African Film and Television Awards (Saftas). Head creative director Brenda Mukwevho attributed the soapie’s success to the fact that it relates to many people in the country. Mukwevho said as a production house, they have been working towards the 10million viewership mission for the past six months. The government’s communication centre issued a statement congratulating the soapie. “Congratulations to Uzalo for setting the bar high by clocking a never-been-done-before 10million viewers mark in South African television history. “A baby in the industry at just three years of existence, the soapie achieved what its peers with decades on television are yet to achieve. They came, they saw, and they conquered.” @SthembisoMedia
