MultiChoice says it wasn’t a tough decision to shut down its DStv Mobile service in South Africa as the pay-TV giant believes the technology is outdated. From next month, the DStv Walka and Drifta service will no longer be available as MultiChoice has decided to axe its DStv DVB-H mobile pay-TV service. This was a service that provided 12 DStv channels via a Drifta device on a laptop, mobile phone or a standalone Walka device. MultiChoice said when it launched the service, the technology was new but “over the last few years technology has evolved. “It’s not feasible for us to continue this dedicated network for this service alone when a better service can be offered to our customers on DStv Now via the internet and wi-fi,” said MultiChoice spokesperson Marietjie Groenewald. She said that MultiChoice had already started shutting down transmitters. “As this might impact the reception of some of our customers, we have no longer been billing for our DStv Mobile service, from September 1. We have also cancelled any further decoder insurance payments for DStv Mobile devices.” It wasn't known how many South African subscribers owned Walkas or Driftas, said Groenewald. She added that DStv Mobile customers could continue to use satellite TV with the DStv Now service. “Streaming TV channels online or through an app on your smartphone or tablet gives you a far superior viewing experience in full HD. "Instead of the 12 channels offered on DStv Mobile, subscribers get access to all of the DStv channels on their package and all of our Catch Up content throughout South Africa. And they can download shows and movies from Catch Up to watch at a later stage." DStv Mobile subscribers have been encouraged to dispose of their Drifta and Walka devices at MultiChoice branches in Randburg, Durban and Cape Town or at DStv agents where there are recycling bins.
