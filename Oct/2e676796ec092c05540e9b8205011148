World Obesity Day - October 11 - was launched in 2015 to stimulate and support practical solutions to help people achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and to reverse the obesity crisis. What is weight stigma? Weight stigma refers to negative behaviours and attitudes that are directed towards individuals, solely because of their weight. Although it has been proved to undermine people’s broader health, weight stigma remains relatively absent from the conversation surrounding obesity. If we are to end the obesity stigma, it’s important to adjust our language and attitudes, raise awareness and improve our knowledge about its extensive impact. By focusing on stigma this World Obesity Day, we aim to: Raise awareness about the presence and impact of weight stigma and what can be done about it. Increase member engagement and encourage engagement with advocacy/campaigning on weight stigma. Help people overcome the barriers that arise as a result of stigma, which can prevent them getting the medical treatment they need. We recommend that all places of work: Implement policies that protect employees, employers, students, and clients with respect, and irrespective of their weight. Take steps to raise awareness about and prevent weight discrimination. - World Obesity Federation
