“I want to show the world that the laws of science cannot define the laws of God because Jesus Christ is everything.” These were the words of Kabelo Matong, who will be competing in the Abacus tournament in Dubai next year. The maths champ studies at the Alpha and Omega Christian Academy in Joburg. He is in Grade 5 but follows the Grade 6 curriculum because of his hard work, excellence and intelligence. Despite winning championships and awards, funding remained a hurdle, but his mom Tebogo Matong was hoping to get Kabelo into a top school for his high school years. Said Kabelo: “I want to study science at Oxford University. I always see successful people doing great things and think to myself, ‘I will also do that some day'.”
