The community of Coligny has welcomed the North West High Court’s decision to find Philip Schutte and Pieter Doorewaard guilty of murdering 16-year-old Matlhomola Mosweu in April last year for “stealing” sunflower seeds. Speaking on behalf of the residents and Mosweu’s family, Reverend David Cele, said: “We are very happy that they have been found guilty, especially since they were not honest during the proceedings, and the circumstances surrounding his horrific death.” Doorewaard, 27, and Schutte, 34, were charged with kidnapping, intimidation and murder. Mosweu died of his injuries in hospital on April 20. "His neck is broken, the head moves loosely from one side to another. He had a cut on his throat, on the chin and at the back of his neck. There is also blood in his month," said Sakkie Dingake, describing how he found his son at the government mortuary in nearby Lichtenburg after the incident. The two accused claimed that he fell off their bakkie while transporting him to a police station 3km away after he allegedly stole sunflower seeds at the Rietvlei farm. The sole eyewitness to the incident revealed that Mosweu was pushed off the moving vehicle. The Star
