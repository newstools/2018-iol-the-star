A woman in her 30s blew herself up in the centre of the Tunisian capital Tunis yesterday, wounding nine people, eight of whom were police officers, in what the Interior Ministry said was a “terrorist explosion”. Witnesses described a blast on the central Habib Bourguiba avenue near the capital's landmark Municipal Theatre. Ambulances were seen rushing to the scene. The ministry confirmed that among those wounded during the explosion, eight of them were police officers. “I was in front of the theatre and heard a huge explosion,” witness Mohamed Ekbal bin Rajib said. Tunisia, which is heavily dependent on tourism, has improved security since a series of militant attacks targeting tourists caused the near collapse of the sector three years ago. In 2015, 21 people were killed during a hostage siege in its national museum, the Bardo in Tunis, and a gunman killed 38 people on a resort beach. Reuters
