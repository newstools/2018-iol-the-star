David Tlale is putting his best foot forward as he sets sights on changing the status quo. The designer is set to push boundaries yet again with his biggest showcase to date that includes a 100-model, 100-look runway collection in honour of the Mandela and Sisulu centenary celebrations. His Spring/Summer 2018/19 collection will be showcased at Sky Pink Studios this afternoon. Tlale, who took the streets of New York by storm earlier with his newest range, Azania, will be expanding on that collection with the 100 garments on display. “Our showcase is one of the biggest we have ever done. We’ll have 100 models to commemorate our struggle heroes Tata Nelson Mandela, Mama Sisulu and all those who fought hard to bring change in our country and aided in who we are today as young people,” said Tlale. “The narrative is all based on taking people on a journey, from workwear, to Parliament, to a cocktail party, to a red carpet, and also making the fashion statement that says, as a fashion house, we celebrate the lives of legends.” This showcase, which was conceived only six months ago, also aims to celebrate women’s inner and outer beauty.  “The name Azania is twofold. The first one is the political movement or revolution.  “When you think about what the term Azania means within the African continent and what we have gone through... it is about bringing change and transformation in South African politics. “I also took it to my spiritual journey, where in Hebrew it means ‘God is listening’. I look back throughout my journey, where I come from, through my 17-year journey in the industry, where I started from, and now having a solid, growing brand. “All this has come from trusting God and what He has said in His Word. I am a strong believer in God, that every time you pray, God answers your prayers and that prayer does work.  “And that is Azania, simply meaning that God listens,” he explains. The Sunday Independent
