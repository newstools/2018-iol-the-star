A new report says African nations are failing to create enough jobs for a booming young population even as some countries have seen strong economic growth. The latest Ibrahim Index of African Governance sounds a warning for a continent where the sub-Saharan population is projected to double by 2050. Africa is seeing the rise of young opposition leaders in countries like Uganda, Zimbabwe and Cameroon who are impatient with some of the world’s oldest or longest-serving heads of state. Experts warn of coming turbulence as about 60% of Africa’s population is under the age of 25. “Africa has a huge challenge ahead. Its large and youthful potential workforce could transform the continent for the better, but this opportunity is close to being squandered,” said Mo Ibrahim, the Sudan-born billionaire who leads the foundation behind the report. “The evidence is clear - young citizens of Africa need hope, prospects and opportunities. Its leaders need to speed up job creation to sustain progress and stave off deterioration.” The report also warns that education in 27 countries across the continent is now on the decline, further hurting the young population’s future.
