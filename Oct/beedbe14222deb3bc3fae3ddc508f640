Tshepo Sedumo is the founder of Joburg-based company Grove Audio. The music man has turned his passion into a thriving business. Grove Audio is a brand of handmade boomboxes designed to deliver the perfect sound, no matter the place. “Grove Audio was an idea that was born from my passion to create. It started off as a simple hobby, just another way to pass the time. As time went by and my skills got better along with my creations, I saw the potential for something great and now here I stand,” said Sedumo. The 26-year-old is proud that each of his products is given the attention it deserves. “Grove Audio products aren’t pumped out in droves on a conveyor belt inside some unnamed factory. “They are each built individually with care and attention to detail and all by hand. By combining quality materials and components such as genuine wood, premium speakers and so on, I’ve managed to take the nostalgic boombox form factor and transform it into something uniquely original, something that you cannot find anywhere else.” Sedumo started operating in March 2016. “It is still early stages. The market varies, the audience has been growing, I am working my way there. Ideally, I would love Grove Audio to be a widely recognised brand in South Africa, something different to what you would find on the shelves.” His self-funded operation is a labour of love, but he is open to opportunities that will allow him to partner with brands that have the same vision as him - building homegrown entrepreneurs. “I offer something unique that people can make their own. My product is a South African product, proudly so.” Apart from just offering standard boomboxes in a variety of great colours and features, Sedumo provides customers the option to customise a product of their choice with the colours they want, additional aesthetic elements and certain features. “We give the term ‘bespoke’ a new meaning in the world of portable sound,” said Sedumo.
