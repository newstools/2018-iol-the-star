That will be no different when this year’s 9th instalment of the Birchwood Jazz Comes Alive evening takes place on Friday, at the Birchwood Hotel and OR Tambo Convention Centre in Boksburg. Multiple award-winning Selaelo Selota and The Muffinz will lead an evening of classic and modern takes on the genre of jazz, as they bring their blend of fans together for a night to remember. Selota, who is known for telling stories through his musical compositions, will show how his inspired traditional songs and dances make him a hard act to follow. If you have not seen the Thrrr...Phaaa! hitmaker perform live, it will be a spectacular show in store. He performed earlier this year on stage and the show went on well into the night. The producer and songwriter will ensure an amazing night for all in attendance. The Muffinz have universal appeal, across all ages, and will fit right in for the second time on the Birchwood stage. The five talented band members all get to showcase their individual talents while working cohesively as a band. Opening act for the night will be the Music School of Jazz Orchestra, who were so well received in previous shows that they will once again be gracing the Birchwood stage at this month’s event. Funnyman Schoolboy, whose real name is Sipho Ntuli, will be tickling the audience’s funny bone with a set that will be filled with hilarious gimmicks. As always, the resident MC Hector Motivator will also be keeping the audience in hysterics. Tickets are R450 per person and R4500 for a table of 10 and includes a three-course meal.
