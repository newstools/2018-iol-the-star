CAPE TOWN – Barbara Creecy, the head of the finance portfolio in Gauteng, has been touted as the top candidate to replace Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene – who is reported to have asked President Cyril Ramaphosa to relieve him of his duties. Nene’s request came after he made the revelation that he had visited the Guptas. Nene revealed these details at the Zondo Commission. Soon afterward, the minister made a public apology about the matter. Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas is also considered a front-runner, along with SA Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago and one of his deputies, Daniel Mminele, according to a report by Bloomberg. President Ramaphosa’s spokesperson said on Monday that his office was not aware of Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene’s request to be relieved of his duties after he admitted to visiting the Gupta brothers. Nene, who was fired as finance minister by Zuma in December 2015, was reappointed to the position by Ramaphosa in February and has been tasked with turning around an economy that fell into recession in the second quarter. He told the Zondo Commission last week about the meetings with the Guptas after previously having said he had only met the three brothers on social occasions, prompting opposition parties to call for him to step down. He also told the commission that he was fired by Zuma because he refused to sign a multi-billion nuclear power pact with Russia that would have crippled South Africa’s finances. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
