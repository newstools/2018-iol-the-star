Telkom has set the ball rolling with the launch of its affordable mobile data campaign. The Summer of More, launched in Maboneng and Braamfontein in Johannesburg on Thursday, aims to enable South Africans to do more with their lives powered by affordable data. In keeping with the mobile data theme, the event was hosted in two venues and streamed live simultaneously with a digital broadcast feast of content. At the Randlords in Braamfontein, high on the 22nd floor, guests were greeted by large live YouTube screens with interactive slides, showcasing the campaign’s promise of free YouTube. In vintage Telkom style, the AGOG Gallery in Maboneng and Randlords venues were immersed in blue, with a matching carpet, setting the mood for a real hi-tech party. The line-up featured Idols SA runner up Keegan Martins’ rooftop performance at Randlords, Manthes dynamic performance at AGOG and live screen feeds from the Kitchen with the Funny Chef Lebogang Tlokana. The cherry on top was Anele Mdoda, who MCeed the gig, Lulo Café on the decks and a fitting performance by the man of the moment Kwesta, who debuted his new hit single Vur-Vay as the telecom giant’s ambassador. Speaking at the launch, Telkom’s marketing and communications executive Thami Majola said: “More than half of data used in South Africa is through the Telkom network. This Summer of More responds to what people are looking for.” The Sunday Independent
