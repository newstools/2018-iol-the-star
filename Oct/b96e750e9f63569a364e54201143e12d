At least four men were arrested this past weekend for demanding that President Emmerson Mnangagwa be held accountable for the killing of an estimated 20000 civilians during atrocities in the 1980s. The chief suspect in the crackdown of perceived opponents of Mnangagwa was named as Wisdom Mkwananzi. He was charged with “undermining authority of or insulting” Mnangagwa, during the public hearing conducted at a local hotel, by the Motlanthe-led commission of inquiry into the August 1 killing of civilians by the army. Some people in the region are enraged at the inquiry into the post-elections deaths, yet a similar probe has not been opened into the decades-old atrocities. Mkwananzi allegedly accused Mnangagwa of masterminding the murder of his parents. Mnangagwa was national security minister during the violations in the Matabeleland and Midlands regions. Police allege Mkwananzi, 32, pointed at Mnangagwa’s portrait, pasted onto a wall, during his testimony before the commission of inquiry. “I am an orphan because of this man. He killed my parents,” he is alleged to have said. Police charged that the suspect had “engendered a feeling of hostility towards or caused hatred or ridicule” of Mnangagwa. He is to appear in court this week facing additional charges of supplying a false name to the commission of inquiry after he allegedly gave Siphatha Mandla as his name. Meanwhile, three other men are due to appear in court next month for allegedly disrupting the commission's inquiry in Bulawayo. Welcome Moyo, Venat Ncube and Marshal Sibanda were arrested for “disorderly and riotous” conduct intended to disrupt the proceedings. CAJ News
