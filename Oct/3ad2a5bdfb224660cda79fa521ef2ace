The squatters at the off-ramp are becoming a serious problem. I almost knocked one over while he was crossing the road in a highly intoxicated state. I hooted at him and he threw a plank at my car, which cracked my windscreen, and he swore at me. I drove on as I was afraid of them. In the mornings it is especially hazardous because they make fires to keep warm, and you can hardly see the road as it is filled with smoke. When one passes in the morning, afternoon or evening there’s smoke all over the place and we can't see clearly the road that we, as ratepayers and taxpayers, are paying to have maintained as decent and habitable surroundings. We are also faced with prostitution and sexual activity in the open in that area. They are making their own brew of alcohol and, when intoxicated, it’s just a total mess and is noisy. Women and men are urinating in public. Makeshift shacks are being erected next to the road, which are a hazard to motorists and a safety worry to all. Sometimes the Joburg metro police department conduct roadblocks and just ignore the situation right in front of their eyes. We, as ratepayers and taxpayers, are now gatvol regarding this situation. Are you waiting for an accident to occur before something gets done, because these vagrants just cross the road whenever they feel like, especially when intoxicated? With the bridge closed for maintenance, these guys are now sleeping on the pavement. There is litter all over the streets, and drivers of cars and trucks are stopping there to relieve themselves on the road. The city replies: The complaint has been forwarded to the by-law management unit to deal with. As the freeway unit, we are removing these people every second night, and they just keep on coming back. The construction and repair of the M2 freeway also compounds the situation, but we will intensify our night-time operations to ensure that they are kept away from the area.
