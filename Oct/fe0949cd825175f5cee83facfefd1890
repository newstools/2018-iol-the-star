Daveyton’s Ntandose Mosibi is the new MTV Base VJ winner. The 25-year-old will join the alumni of presenters that have taken their careers to the next level through the talent search. The likes of Sizwe Dhlomo, Fikile “Fix” Moeti, Nomuzi Mabena, Sandile Ntshingila and Tshego Koke have all used the opportunity as a stepping stone to greater career moves. Mosibi, who describes herself as passionate, strong and colourful stood out from over 8000 hopefuls and her fellow finalists, Namibian born Cape Town based, Nalitye Shaninga and Angolan born Joburger, Jonatao Morais to take the ‘throne’. “I still cannot believe I won, feels like someone is going to wake me up and say I am being pranked, it all hasn’t sunk in. I am super excited to be part of the MTV Base team, finally, my dreams to work on television are coming true,” said Mosibi. In the finale episode hosted by Tshego Koke on Wednesday night, audiences witnessed the four cities tour – Durban, Cape Town, East London and Johannesburg – through the experiences of the judges; award-winning actor and funny man Thomas Gumede (Ridiculousness Africa), presenter and actress Boity Thulo, singer Kelly Khumalo and comedian Tol A$$ Mo (You Got Got). This was followed by the personal experiences of the three finalists which ended with Ntandose Mosibi being declared the winner of the competition and scooping up the prizes worth over half a million rand.      These include a 12-month contract with MTV Base, a year’s supply Breezers, a brand new Tipo from vehicle manufacturer Fiat, and an all-expenses paid trip to Thailand courtesy of Breezer to celebrate her win. “Ntandose’s win will transform her life, as many may have witnessed with Tshego Koke’s win in 2017. We are thrilled to have her as part of the MTV family and look forward to growing her brand within the MTV Base brand,” said Monde Twala, Vice President for Youth, Music and BET at Viacom International Media Networks Africa (VIMN Africa).
