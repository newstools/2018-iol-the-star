President Cyril Ramaphosa has not been able to travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for a Bi-National Commission owing to an upper respiratory tract infection, the Presidency said yesterday. “President Ramaphosa was due to travel to Kinshasa on Monday, but was advised by doctors to recover before undertaking prolonged travel. The president is receiving medical attention and making a good recovery,” said the Presidency. “President Cyril Ramaphosa and President Joseph Kabila of the DRC will at a future stage ratify the agreements reached between the two countries at the 11th Session of the Bi-National Commission currently under way in Kinshasa.” Khusela Diko, the spokesperson for the president, said: “The South African government has been in communication with the government of the DRC regarding this change in President Ramaphosa's schedule and has expressed its appreciation for the DRC's hosting of the official and ministerial deliberations that have taken place in Kinshasa in preparation for the participation of the two heads of government in the Bi-National Commission.” She said the two presidents would at a future date ratify the outcomes of the Bi-National Commission. International Relations and Co-operation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu is already in the DRC. ANA
