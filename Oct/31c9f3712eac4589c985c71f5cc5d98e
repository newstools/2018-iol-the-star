JOHANNESBURG - Just like in a Hollywood movie, a police helicopter landed on the N1 freeway and an officer ran out to the bushes wielding a machinegun. Minutes later he returned with a subdued suspect, waved at astonished motorists and flew away. This was caught on camera by Edenvale resident, business coach and inspirational speaker, Alvin Govender yesterday on theÂ N1 from Pretoria to Joburg. He posted the video on Facebook. "A police (officer) runs with a firearm into the bushes and returns 3 min later with a suspect. Police arrests suspect and the guy returns to helicopter, waves at us and flys away. Like a movie. Lol. (sic)" Govender later said he received information that this was a special unit within SAPS and police were responding to an armed robbery. "Inspiring to witness...the guy was too cool. Stopped the traffic like a pro. They have to be well trained to do this...how's that for excellence in service. Well done," he posted.   The Star
