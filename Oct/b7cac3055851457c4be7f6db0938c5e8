Johannesburg- A Soweto man is alleged to have assaulted his former girlfriend when he found her with her new lover then robbed the man before feeling. The 24 year old man has only recently been arrested after being on the run for two months. Police spokesperson Captain Hitler Ngwenya said the suspect went to his ex girlfriend's house in August  around midnight. There, the man found his ex girlfriend with her new boyfriend. Ngwenya said allegations are that the man forced the woman to leave with him but she refused. "When she refused, he dragged her on the ground and fired two shots next to her feet. He then robbed the woman's new boyfriend of his wallet that had an undisclosed amount,” he said. Ngwenya said the man had been wanted for some time and it was when officers were doing a stop and search in Pimville that one resident told them where the man lives. He said the man  was arrested and is now facing an attempted murder charge as well as robbery. Ngwenya said the man had been wanted for other crimes. He also said there were a lot of unlicensed fire arms in Soweto and that they were working with residents to remove those guns from the area. @SthembisoMedia The Star
