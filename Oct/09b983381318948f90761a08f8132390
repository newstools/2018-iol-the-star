Available in four cool metallics, the hip "carry me" laptop is the accessory to have. I'm definitely moving to the greener side of life where heavy laptops are a thing of the past. Let’s be honest, for as much as they try to make laptop bags look cute, carrying a heavy machine in them is just a 'no' for me. So I was super-excited when the Swift 3 could fit comfortably in my chic, black work bag. My shoulder was also very happy; it weighs only 1.45kg. The aluminium body is cool and gives it serious personality. Open the laptop and you are met with a crisp screen that illuminates colour on its HD1 resolution. I learnt the importance of a narrow bezel design - bezel refers to the outside frame around a computer tower or monitor. With the Acer, the viewing area is expanded because of this. The display also utilises IPS technology, that’s why the colour is so vivid. If you are a fan of really getting the colour game right, you can use the Acer colour intelligence to maximise the brightness. I'm a big fan of the Windows 10 operating system on the Acer, which allows for multitasking. The Windows Hello is password-free, making it super-convenient to use. I have only recently realised the importance of using calendar notes and scheduling my life, and the laptop’s easy use and alerts made it so much easier for me to manage my life. With a storage space of up to 256 gigabytes there is ample space to save all my documents. The battery life is also pretty great. My home laptop lasts a good two hours before it breaks down - but I've had it for years. The Acer can go up to 12 hours so you can watch movies and get some project work done. The Acer Swift retails for R12899.  @Mane_mpi
