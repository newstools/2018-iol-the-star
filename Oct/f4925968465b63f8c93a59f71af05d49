Obesity is defined as being grossly overweight, and it is a chronic and potentially fatal disease that contributes to cancer, heart attacks, arthritis and psychological problems. As the country commemorates National Obesity Week, awareness is being raised about the impact of being overweight. National Obesity Week started ­yesterday and ends on October19. To kickstart the drive, the Healthy Living Alliance (Heala) was due to picket outside Coca-Cola’s offices in Rosebank, Joburg on Tuesday to demand that the company honour its commitment to stop advertising to children and provide healthier beverage alternatives in schools. This follows a survey audit conducted by Heala in Gauteng showed that Coca-Cola had not fulfilled its commitment to stop advertising and selling sugary drinks to children without offering alternatives, as per an instruction from the Consumer Goods Act of South Africa. Also, in 2012 Coca-Cola made a pledge at the EU to stop advertising to children, but it has not done so. Coca-Cola spokesperson Camila Osborne said the company was aware of Heala’s plan to picket at their premises. She also acknowledged obesity was a serious issue and said they would be willing to listen to the demands that would be delivered today. “We have engaged with Heala but it was not fruitful. They have informed that they will be issuing a memorandum to us, which will we receive with an open mind,” said Osborne.
