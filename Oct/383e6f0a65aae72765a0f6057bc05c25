An off duty security guard was found with gunshots wounds in an open veld next to the N12 freeway in Protea South. The 30 year-old man was apparently returning from work and was expected by his family to arrive at home on Friday but never made it. The Star understands that the man was living with his partner and two children and was working in Carletonville at the time of his death. SAPS spokesperson Sergeant Khalipha Mvula said the night before the man was killed, gun shots were heard in the area. “According to some members of the community, several gun shots were heard on Saturday night between 8pm and 9pm and the body was only discovered on Sunday morning  around 4am .The motive for the murder is still under investigation and no arrests have been made so far,” he said. The man was still dressed in his uniform and had multiple gun shot wounds on his upper body. In a separate incident, two security guards were shot and killed near Maponya Mall in Soweto. Speaking to The Star, Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said police were hunting two suspects who shot and killed the two 24/7 Security guards. He said the incident happened last week Wednesday. The shooting which was captured on a video which has gone viral, shows the guards sitting inside the car with one guard reading a magazine while the other one is taking a nap. After a few seconds, shots are fired leading to the death of the security guards.  The suspects then rob one guard of his firearms and they both flee the scene. Dlamini said there hasn’t been any arrest made so far. @SthembisoMedia
