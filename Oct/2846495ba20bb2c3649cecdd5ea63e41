Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina officially opened the state-of-the-art fire station on Friday and it is expected that it willÂ  which will serve the Germiston CBD, the Germiston precinct, the Ekurhuleni mining belt, Dukathole and Good Hope informal settlements, Rand Airport and industrial areas surrounding Germiston. The newly refurbished fire station will have enough parking space to accommodate a hydraulic platform fire engine, a water tanker fire engine, a major water pumper fire engine, as well as a smaller grass unit fire engine to be used for confined spaces. At least three ambulances will also be based there. The station is strategically designed for easy access for the fire engines during and after responding to the calls. On same day, the mayor also launched a fleet that included 37 ambulances, two major pumpers with a 4000-litre tank capacity, two water tankers with 10000-litre tank capacity each and one major rescue pumper only used to carry rescue equipment. A new hydraulic platform, Bronto Sky Lighter, which can reach a height of 37 metres is included in the new fleet. It is similar to the one used to douse the fire in the Joburg CBD last month when the Ekurhuleni emergency services division was called to assist putting out the fire which claimed the lives of three City of Joburg firefighters. The emergency services also demonstrated a water transfer system at Germiston Lake, which is the only one of its kind in Africa. The system can transfer water from the open source to a distance of about 5km at a high pressure rate for a sustainable supply at the major fire scenes. The system can supply about eight fire engines with enough pressure for the entire operation on the scene. Speaking during the launch, Masina said the R56.6-million new station was an investment into the businesses, the community and the citizens at large and neighbouring cities.
