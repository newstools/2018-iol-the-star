THE sun is always shining when Nomisupasta is around. She carries happiness in her palm and her energy exudes wherever she goes. The new mom has a different take on life since giving birth to her daughter and two new singles to get her music game back in action. “The first single is called You Are and it is inspired by my daughter. It is about the journey to motherhood and what happens to a person when they become one. The lyrics talk about: ‘You gotta live without regret, you’ve got to live without resentment.’ That is one of the valuable things becoming a mother taught me.My spirit has to be light and my energy has to be good if I’m bringing a human into the world. You have to be able to forgive, as we go through life and adulting, things happen and a lot of people hold onto things and are unable to forgive and let go.” Nomisupasta whose real name is Nomsa Mazwai, youngest sister to Thandiswa and Ntsiki Mazwai. “It’s so incredible what happens as a human being when you focus on the positive, you start seeing how much there is and that’s what my daughter gave me.” The single was done by beatmaker Spoek Soweto. “It’s a combination of Little Dragon, Sam Smith and James Blake. These are some of the influences that I love. What drew me to this beat is all the music that I loved hearing in the last eight to 10 years. It’s also got a tinge of reggae in it as well.” Her other single Losing Myself was done with house boss Harrison Crump who also mixed and mastered You Are. “With music and art you open up your soul and bear yourself. When you do that and work with people they make that a comfortable space. The beat was supposed to be on his last album but he kept saying it needed something special. Once I heard it I started dancing and the beat just captured my essence. I am the light, the sun. I’m all about dancing and having a good time.” The two singles are available on digital platforms and Nomisupasta will be performing them at Afropunk in December.
