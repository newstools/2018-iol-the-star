This will exhibit the network of newly proposed Marine Protected Areas (MPA). MPAs form part of our coastline and the open oceans, which are specifically protected for the benefit of people and the environment. They assist with managing a part of the marine environment by keeping marine ecosystems flourishing and protecting the species that depend on the ecosystem for their survival. Sanbi chief executive Dr Moshibudi Rampedi said: “A healthy ecosystem increases the resilience to climate change, and it also provides a satisfactory experience to tourists who visit South Africa to experience the country’s distinctive ocean wildlife. “South Africa is strategically positioned as it occupies space in three oceans: the Indian, the Atlantic and the Southern oceans. “It is a unique concept as South Africa is the only country in the world that contributes to the preservation of ocean life in three different oceans at the same time.” South Africa is also the only African country that occupies territory in the Southern Ocean, represented by Prince Edward Island and its vast ocean area, lying 2500km south-east of Cape Town. “It has been a privilege to support the exploration, conservation, sustainable use, appreciation and enjoyment of South Africa’s exceptional marine biodiversity,” said Sanbi’s marine programme manager, Dr Kerry Sink. The website highlights 12 years of marine biodiversity science and systematic planning. The work is seen as a reflection of how foundational science is used to build knowledge and the informing of policies and actions.
