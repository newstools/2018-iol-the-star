She was speaking in Joburg at the launch of a photographic book on the life and times of the first Mozambican president. Graça Machel, also the widow of Nelson Mandela, said: “It is not about Samora alone as a person. When you read this book you will understand the struggles that you are going through today. “Samora lives in each and every one of us.” The book, Samora Machel, is a collection of photographers by the late Kok Nam, a Mozambican photojournalist of Chinese descent. At the launch of the book at the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Houghton on Thursday night, former Constitutional Court judge Albie Sachs said: “Samora died for our liberation. He was on a mission to get the Frontline States to have solidarity. These days, people speak about how easy it is to cross the borders, but they forget how the neighbouring countries helped us,” he said.
