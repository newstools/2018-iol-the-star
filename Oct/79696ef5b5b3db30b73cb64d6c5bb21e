A few weeks ago Reddy was given a merit award on behalf of Unisa Bureau of Market Research by Vice-chancellor and Principal Professor Mandla Makhanya, in Pretoria. Reddy was praised for his philanthropy and support of numerous educational and welfare organisations, community centres, health associations, feeding schemes, conservation programmes and peace and cultural initiatives. Presenting Reddy with the recognition, Makhanya said: “To date, Mr Reddy has provided numerous educational bursaries to deserving students and launched the Orphans of Aids Trust, which he also continues to sponsor. Reddy executes his philanthropy through his patronage of several organisations in the areas of education, religion, the disabled, welfare organisations, community centres including feeding schemes, health associations and conservation programmes, as well as peace and cultural initiatives.” Reddy said he was overwhelmed by the warm gesture: “All these recognitions encourage me to strive on with greater commitment to uplift the less fortunate among us. A rich man is poor when he cannot reach out to the less fortunate that surround us." This is not the first time Reddy has been recognised for his philanthropy. He has received numerous humanitarian awards from across the world. Reddy is a recipient of the Paul Harris International Fellowship Award and, earlier this year, the lifetime international award for social, philanthropy and business success at the House of Commons in London, the lower House of the British parliament The award recognises individuals who have made a difference in their communities.
