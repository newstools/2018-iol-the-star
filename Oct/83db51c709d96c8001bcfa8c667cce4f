Johannesburg - The two men caught on dash-cam callously killing two security guards in Soweto remain on the run. Captain Mavela Masondo told The Star on Thursday that the police were still looking for clues that could help them land the men who assassinated Eric Ngobese, 38 and Boykie Moyo, 47, behind bars. Ngobese and Moyo, attached to 24/7 Security Services, were shot dead near Maponya Mall last Wednesday. A 30-second video clip showing them being ambushed and fatally shot while sitting in their work car went viral. The two men ran off after taking a pistol from one of the guards. It appeared that they pounced on Ngobese and Moyo to rob them of their firearms. An off-duty metro police officer was also killed for his gun on the streets of Hillbrow last month. Earlier, police dismissed as fake news a claim that the two killers had been nabbed during an operation by the tactical response team. “They have still not been arrested,” Masondo said. “The police have launched a manhunt for the suspects who shot and killed the two security guards in Soweto. “We’re appealing to the community that if there’s anyone with information that can help us arrest these suspects, please come forward. “They can call the nearest police station or 10111,” said Masondo. @BonganiNkosi87 The Star
