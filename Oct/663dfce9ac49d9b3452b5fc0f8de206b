“It’s very unfortunate, unnecessary and uncalled for; other than that, I don’t really want to comment,” said Daubermann yesterday. On Wednesday, angry protesters, including the #TotalShutDown movement, threw water and hurled comments at Daubermann, including calling him a “rubbish defending a rapist”. They demanded that he drop the case and threatened that they knew where he lived. Enraged protesters bayed for Daubermann’s blood as police escorted him to his car, which was parked at the back of the court building. The protesters were at court to support State witness Cheryl Zondi, 22, who had been under cross-examination for a third consecutive day, with many accusing Daubermann of overstepping the mark during his questioning of Zondi, who has alleged that Omotoso, 60, sexually assaulted her when she was 14 years old. Chaos erupted outside the court building shortly after the trial had adjourned for the day. Omotoso’s supporters and people showing support for rape survivors had to be separated by police after they attacked one another. Protesters supporting Zondi also verbally attacked a woman they identified as Zoleka Ncapayi. They claimed she was a social worker and called her a “sell-out for supporting a rapist”. Daubermann has been widely criticised by the public for his aggressive questioning during cross-examination. African News Agency (ANA)
