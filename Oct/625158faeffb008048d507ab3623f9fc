Soweto police are investigating a case of murder after a  32 year old man was shot and killed at the Nancefield hostel. It is believed that the man was from Vryheid in Kwa-Zulu Natal and visiting friends from the hostel when he was shot and killed. The killing happened not far from where two security guards were shot and killed as they sat in their vehicles last week Wednesday. Police spokesperson Sergeant Khalipha Mvula said the incident happened on Saturday afternoon. He said the man was seated next to the door inside the hostel with his friends when several gun shots rang. “A short while later (after several gun shots) another gun shot went off from outside the room and the 32 year old was hit on the face and he died instantly. “Upon further investigation it was established that there were two holes on the window pane caused by gun shots,” he said. Mvula said it was not clear how long the man had been at the hostel or in Johannesburg. He also said the motive for the murder was not yet known and that police investigation was underway. So far, there hasn’t been any arrest made, he said.  Mvula said over the past two months there was no shooting reported at the hostel.
