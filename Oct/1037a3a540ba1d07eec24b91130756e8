Ansley kidnapped, raped and murdered 10-year-old Chrisainya June Nikita Carelse in Reiger Park last year. Her bloodied body was found in a field in Ekurhuleni. She was found half naked with a large cement block on her chest. In addition to being bludgeoned with a blunt object, she was stabbed in her neck and vagina. On Friday, Judge Thomas Mathunzi handed Ansley two life-terms for murdering and raping a minor and five years for kidnapping. “Saying the deceased was killed like an animal is truly an understatement,” Mathunzi said. The judge said he could not find compelling circumstances to deviate from the prescribed jail terms. Contrary to his lawyer’s argument, Ansley’s youthful age was not a compelling factor either, said Mathunzi. “I can’t find that the accused can be rehabilitated.” Ansley kidnapped Chrisainya from her grandmother’s two-room shack. The grandmother was intoxicated after drinking alcohol with Johnson at his house. He accompanied her back to her shack just before 1am. Chrisainya, who was well known to her killer, was found dead the next morning. Ansley was arrested three days after the discovery. He was released due to lack of evidence, but thanks to DNA extracted from a blood-stained shirt, he was re-arrested and charged four months later.Prosecutor André Maharaj told the court Ansley had not shown regret for his heinous act. “The accused has still not displayed remorse, he’s unapologetic." @BonganiNkosi87
