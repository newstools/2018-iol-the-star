A teacher has been arrested for the alleged bribery of an investigation officer following an investigation into a cash for post scandal. Five other department of education officials are implicated. Among those are a principal, two General Assistants (GAs) at Kwa-Bhekilanga Secondary School in Alexandra and two HR Personnel at Johannesburg East District.
