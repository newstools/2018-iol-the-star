Tbo Touch - whose real name is Thabo Molefe - has partnered with fashion lifestyle retailer The Foschini Group (TFG) in this year's Delivering Happiness to Diepsloot event. TFG will be donating 13000 blankets and meal packs to a school in Diepsloot. Speaking to The Star yesterday, the businessman, who has been running the project over the past years with Steyn City, said: “Sometimes we should mobilise the brands to come and assist communities. I am glad that this is not a once-off initiative.” Last year saw trucks filled with school bags, school books, shoes, food and much more being delivered to various schools in Diepsloot. On October 30, there will be a golf day at Steyn City during the day and later there will be a handover to a group of learners. TFG’s Mymoena Mooradd said it was important for the company to be part of this project. “We were so inspired by the work Tbo Touch is doing for the children and community of Diepsloot. We were thrilled to get involved and help to bring smiles to the faces of our future leaders. TFG’s key focus area is to educate to empower, which encompasses meeting the basic needs of those who need it most,” Mooradd said. Molefe said he was also working on a nationwide empowerment mentorship workshop. “Between January and March next year, I will be going around the country looking for 2000 young people. I will be going with 88 influential black entrepreneurs. We will be empowering them to succeed,” he said. @SthembisoMedia  The Star
