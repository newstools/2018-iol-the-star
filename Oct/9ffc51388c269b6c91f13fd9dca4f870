In South Africa, with our unending multiple fatal crashes, one would be spoilt for choice. In the past month alone we've had so many grim crashes involving buses, trucks and cars that the media have run out of adjectives to describe the horror. The sad part is that behind these statistics were souls whose deaths have left behind untold grief, sorrow and emptiness. It's only when names are released that it dawns that real people have died in those wreckages. Last week alone, six people were killed in an accident along the N1 in Modimolle, Limpopo, near the crash site that claimed the lives of at least 26 people on October 19. On the same day, nine people lost their lives along the N4 between Mbombela and Malelane in Mpumalanga. The toll keeps climbing. When will it end? Sol Makgabutlane is an assistant editor at The Star.
