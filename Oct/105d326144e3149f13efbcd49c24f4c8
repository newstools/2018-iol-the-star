Johannesburg - The Gauteng Department of Education is still struggling to place over 89 236 pupils in schools.The department earlier this year opened the online application system for Grade 1 and 8 pupils for the 2019 academic year. They have since appealed for patience from parents and said they are working hard to place all pupils. Gauteng Education spokesperson Steve Mabona said between April 16 and May 28, the department processed a total of 282 823 applicants. Of those, 149 461 are Grade 1 applicants and 133 362 for 8 applicants. “The department has to date made 193 587 offers of placement to applicants and as of August 7, 2018, 74421 of the offers were accepted. “However, 119 166 offers of placement (had to) be accepted by August 16, 2018, as failure to accept these offers will result in applicants losing their space at the school.” Mabona also stated that there were  89 236 applicants with no offers of placement but that. The date for late applications will be announced soon, he added. “The department is committed to ensuring that all pupils are placed on time and receive quality basic education. “Once more, we take this time to assure parents that all online applications for Grade 1 and 8 received in April and May, will be placed. “We call on parents to be patient as our call centre is inundated with a high volume of calls, which gives a false impression that calls ring unanswered. “The reality is that call centre agents spend on average between 15 and 20 minutes on a call. “Eighty percent of the calls received assist with resetting passwords, while 20% assist with pending district processing.” For instance, he said on August 3 the call centre received 14 085 calls and 17 996 on August 5. “All schools made offers of placement to parents from August 3, 2018, for Grade 1 and Grade 8. “Qualifying applicants received more than one offer of placement in line with the number of applications submitted. “When an offer is confirmed, all the other remaining offers are deactivated. “The deactivated offers will create more spaces on the schools waiting lists for further placements to be offered to other parents. “Parents who were rejected at all five schools where they applied and those who have not received an offer of placement will be placed by Districts,” Mabona added.
