The fund said board members Jacobus Bodenstein, Hendrik Myburgh, Zazi Zulu, Sipho Miya, Maxwell Magubane, Christiaan Laubscher, Marchel Coetzee, Anthony Botes, Robert Dube and Lipson Baloyi had voluntarily stepped down. The resignations follow a deed of settlement between the fund and the Financial Services Conduct Authority (FSCA) at the instructions of the North Gauteng High Court recently. According to the order, at least 10 members were to tender their resignations by September 17 and serve their notice until today. Prior this order, the fund had 20 members on its board. However, the chairperson of the PSSPF’s claims subcommittee, Dube, said some in the exiting group tendered their resignations in the best interests of the fund. “To find an amicable solution in resolving the issues with the FSCA, the board had to reduce the number of serving trustees by 50%. This entailed the trustees voluntarily resigning at the end of September and serving their notice period till the end of November 2018. It was not an admission of any wrongdoing from those who resigned. The board in its decision-making had to act with utmost good faith towards the fund and in the best interest of all members,” Dube said. Prior to the court process, the FSCA had been investigating allegations that the fund was being mismanaged and that the policy of a per-meeting fee was being abused by some trustees which resulted in heavy financial losses to the fund. It was found that some trustees were being paid R7900 for attending a single board meeting and R5768 for a subcommittee meeting. The FSCA added that there were more actual meetings than the ones planned. In June 2017 there were 19 planned meetings, when it fact 66 were held, resulting in one trustee pocketing R190000 in that month alone. As a result of this and other financial mismanagement issues, the FSCA launched a court application to have the fund put under administration. @lindilesifile
