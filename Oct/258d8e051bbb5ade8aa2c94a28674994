Judge Makaula also dismissed an application for leave to appeal his earlier decision not to quash the charges against Omotoso and his alleged accomplices, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho. Defence attorney Peter Daubermann indicated he would now follow a process to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal. The case was postponed provisionally to December 10. The Nigerian pastor faces 63 main charges and 34 alternative counts, which include human trafficking, rape, sexual assault, racketeering and conspiracy in aiding another person to commit sexual assault. Sulani and Sitho are accused of recruiting girls from all over the country for purposes of sexual exploitation. Omotoso allegedly trafficked more than 30 girls and women, from various branches of his church, to a house in uMhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, where he allegedly sexually exploited them.
