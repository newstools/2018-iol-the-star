Siya Kolisi knows what it's like to go to school hungry. He may be the captain of the national rugby team now but it took a lot of determination for him to get there.  Kolisi has joined international advocacy organisation Global Citizen as an advocate for ending hunger and for education. “It’s a huge opportunity for me. I'm honoured to be part of it because the movement reaches many people and aims to make the world a better place. I'm happy to share my thoughts and fight for something I believe in,” he said. “I've lived through hunger. I know what it feels like and my thing is to make sure I use this platform to work with the organisation to make sure I can make an impact not only for this generation but for future ones as well.” Global Citizen has been calling on the government of Zambia to commit and show leadership at the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 on December 2 by increasing nutrition spending by R581 a child. This would mean spending an additional R364m a year towards nutrition. Currently, 40 out of 100 children are stunted and at risk of cognitive and physical limitations that can last a lifetime. The Springbok captain was joined by singer Nandi Madida and Zambian songwriter Cleo Ice Queen as part of the delegation in talks with the vice-president of Zambia, Inonge Wina, a national nutrition champion.
