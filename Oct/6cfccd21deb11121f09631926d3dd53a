The Springs Fresh Produce Market is home to 14 ripening rooms used not only to ripen bananas, but also to store the fruit. It is not common knowledge that bananas are harvested when still green, and they start ripening as soon as the stem is cut. To make them more palatable, adequate ripening and storage is required, a responsibility that lies partly with Holiday Molapo from the produce market. With 18 years of experience as a senior floor inspector and overseer of the banana ripening process, Molapo knows that this role requires dedication and attention to detail. “On receiving bananas in bulk from local and neighbouring countries’ farms, we treat them like babies because bananas are sensitive and need to be treated with care. Like babies, we nurture and watch them closely until they grow. We also ensure the bananas are palatable and have a longer shelf life,” Molapo said. Banana ripening involves the preparation of the green fruit for sale to consumers. Ethylene treatment is used to speed up the process while maintaining the nutrients and quality of the fruit. Once ripening begins, the race to the consumer is on. On average, 120 pallets are sold each day. Plans are in the pipeline for an additional 12 ripening rooms. As a result of the high demand for bananas, the ethylene gas technology used guarantees ripening within three days of harvesting - compared to the traditional method where farmers use “gunny” bags in a process that takes between seven and 14 days. “To do this job you must be alert at all times to monitor the pulp temperatures closely and avoid chilling or cooking the fruit,” Molapo explained. Chilling will occur if the fruit is subject to temperatures below 13°C for several hours.  The ripening rooms are also used to store the bananas not sold at a set temperature to maintain their quality. The Star
