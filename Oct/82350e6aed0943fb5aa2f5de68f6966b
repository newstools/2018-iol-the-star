This was resolved following the City of Joburg obtaining a court interdict to stop the protests and arresting several protesters. Pikitup was operating with limited capacity due to the failure to manage the transition of its ad hoc fleet contracts. Joburg mayoral committee for environment and infrastructure development, Nico de Jager, said services would be fully restored by tomorrow. The ad hoc fleet contract served to provide additional vehicles to compensate for the attrition of Pikitup’s aged fleet, he explained. “In order to ensure that service delivery suffers minimal interruption, a meeting was held with senior Pikitup management yesterday to put into place a plan that will mitigate the level of disruption to our residents. In the interim, Pikitup, through maximising its existing fleet and operating additional overtime shifts, would ensure that the maximum level of refuse removal rounds were achieved under the circumstances. De Jager said he had requested a full investigation. “We cannot tolerate a situation where service delivery to residents is compromised. I will ensure Pikitup will be issuing communication from our respective regional depots advising residents of the progress,” he added. Anna Cox anna.cox@inl.co.za @annacox
