Delivering his Mid-Term Budget speech, Mboweni said he had received 3299 tweets from users when he asked for advice from them. @SimplyThandeka said: “Congratulations to all who have been campaigning for free sanitary pads in all schools! My only worry now is that tender system corrupt are going to charge the nation R50 a pad. I’m not kidding. You know these peeps #MTBPS2018.” @Lbabsie wrote: “Budget speech: so much to clap and be joyful about. Just to mention a few that affect everyday life: data, free sanitary pads for poorer school, no VAT for pads and flour.” @JasonHalfon said: “Making sanitary pads tax free is possibly one of the only things this current government can be proud of. Those developed countries who have yet to do this - heads should be bowed down in shame. #MTBPS2018.” Mboweni was also praised for announcing that the government would work towards reducing data costs and improving its quality. @Janera_ said: “So far, #Tito- Mboweni has not said anything that hasn’t been said before. The bit about bringing down data costs is hopeful, it will assist entrepreneurs and SMEs, but our govt has a history of talking a lot and implementing little. Amaze us, Min Mboweni. #MTBPS2018.” @sthebeMC tweeted: “@tito_mboweni there must be data subsidy and decrease of petrol. Sanitary pads must be provided for free to every girl. Condoms including maxx must be sold.” Other users were however not happy that Mboweni called on motorists to pay for e-tolls. Nelson Mandela’s personal aide and author @ZeldalaGrangeSA tweeted: “I will not pay e-tolls until the money set aside in preparation of the 2010 SWC for infrastructure, which largely went to overseas companies, and the rest looted, is recovered." @smashaba
