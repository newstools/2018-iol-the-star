Joburg residents are being warned to reduce their water consumption or face restrictions. The Randjesfontein reservoir and tower in the Midrand area are affected by the restriction of supply by Rand Water. There are two tankers in Bally James Duff Avenue to supply emergency water. Member of the mayoral committee for environment and infrastructure Nico de Jager has appealed to all to use water sparingly, reminding them that level 1 water restrictions were in place. The watering of gardens is not allowed between 6am and 6pm in summer. This is until March 31. Residents may also not wash paved areas and driveway using hose pipes. De Jager said residents would be fined if they contravene by-laws. Water-saving tips:  Do not leave taps dripping. Wash your car on the grass. Use a watering can instead of a hosepipe. Shorten your time in the shower. Use a glass of water to rinse when brushing your teeth. Avoid filling your bath to a depth greater than 100mm.
