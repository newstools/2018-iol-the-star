Johannesburg - Angry commuters torched two train carriages at Germiston Station in Ekurhuleni in frustration over being late for work for a second day running after scheduled trains experienced delays on Tuesday morning. The delay was caused by an early morning commuter fatality at Denver station in Joburg. The man was run over by a train while crossing the railway tracks between platforms. The Star visited the Denver train station shortly after the commuter, who has been identified as 37-year-old Lindokhuhle Mazeka, was killed. Angry commuters said Mazeka was killed while jumping train tracks because he could not use a subway which links platforms at the station. The body of  Lindokhuhle Mazeka lies between tracks at Denver train station. According to Ward 65 councillor Lindani Zulu the tunnel, which emits a stomach-churning stench, has been flooded for several months now. Stoppages caused by the commuter's death angered passengers, who, it is alleged, started burning carriages at Germiston station.   #TrainFires: Two trains have been set alight at Germiston Station.

 October 16, 2018   A row ensued and commuters allegedly started fighting with police and security personnel. Emergency services were on the scene, but could not immediately douse the flames as there was apparently no water at the train station. Mazeka's brother Ayanda expressed devastation at the loss of a man he called a mentor. He said the rest of the family in Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal, was not coping with the news. @khayakoko88 The Star
