Zikhona Mndela, 23, cut a forlorn figure at the dock in the South Gauteng High Court on Wednesday where the state wants her jailed for allegedly concealing the birth of her newborn baby girl and later killing her in Klipfontein, near Tembisa, in October 2016. According to the indictment, Mndela gave birth on her own then put her healthy infant in a plastic bag and 20-litre paint bucket and buried her. DNA results positively proved the infant found dead was Mndela’s child. Her trial was starting at a time when it appeared the number of abandoned infants was increasing. Emergency services group ER24 found at least seven babies in plastic bags and dustbins in Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal in the past week. Last month, a 26-year-old mother was arrested for allegedly leaving her newborn baby at a dump in the Eastern Cape and another infant was found in Galeshewe in the Northern Cape. Prosecutor Jacqueline Drotsky told the court that a decision to charge Mndela with murder was taken after some consideration. Mndela’s trial began with her ex-boyfriend, Nhlanhla Maseko and former best friend, Unathi Ludidi, testifying on behalf of the State. Maseko testified that he suggested an abortion as they were not employed. Ludidi said Mndela had tried to hide her pregnancy, until Ludidi was called to assist her, and found her stained in blood and weak. The trial continues.
