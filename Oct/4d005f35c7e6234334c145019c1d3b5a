“I am greater than HIV. I went from my deathbed to the world. I want to get people to talk about HIV, not only on December 1, but every day,” the bubbly Motsumi said. As a 29-year-old mother of one, Motsumi describes herself as a young and HIV-positive woman who unapologetically calls herself #UbabesWeHIV on social media in the name of fighting stigma and starting conversations about the disease. “We have to start realising that HIV is something we have to talk about every day. Gone are those days when we had to stay at home, away from even our families, just because we were infected with HIV,” Motsumi said. “We need to normalise conversations around HIV, and social media is a powerful tool. There is power attached to calling myself #UbabesWeHIV. It doesn’t mean HIV defines me. This is what I am doing to get to the people. People would feel that it is extreme, and some have asked why I call myself that.” She has now written a book about her life, I’m Still Here - From My Deathbed To The World. Motsumi said she was molested when she was 5 and raped twice as a teenager, and was diagnosed with HIV when she was 17. She said she had had an abortion, lost her first-born child when she was 16 and had been diagnosed with depression and kidney disease. Motsumi said although she was sexually abused and raped, she had not had the courage to go to the police to open a case. She said one of her abusers was a police officer. She says the story of Fezekile “Khwezi” Ntsukela Kuzwayo, who accused former president Jacob Zuma of rape, had inspired her. @smashaba
