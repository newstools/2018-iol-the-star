A prison warder has been recorded while allegedly drunk at work and had no idea where his firearm was. In the footage, the Correctional Services employee can be seen lying on his chair with a coat covering his head. He is woken up and upon talking, his speech is clearly impaired. When asked if he was fit to work he insisted ; “I’m fine for duty… I’m fine Meneer (Sir)”. However, following a call for him to stand on one leg from the person who seemed to have been recording the footage and referred to himself as the Captain, the warder stumbled.  Another instruction to the warder to stand on one leg resulted in him responding; “Ah, Mr Manner. No man”.   The seemingly inebriated man was asked where he firearm was and he had no clue. “Ntoshi, I left my firearm here!,” he said in IsiXhosa to another person who was not in the shot. The Correctional Services Department says it is investigating the conduct of the warder who was caught on camera allegedly drunk at work. The Department's Singabakho Nxumalo said: “We must be seen to be really taking firm action against this. We have a number of good officials in our department [and] we can never allow the conduct of this nature to taint our image in a manner that it is done.” The Star
