Johannesburg - Actor Rapulana Seiphemo, probably best known for his role as Tau Mogale in the soapie Generations: The Legacy, appeared briefly at the Johannesburg Commercial Crime Court on Thursday morning on tax evasion charges. The State has accused Seiphemo of failing to submit income tax returns from 2013 to 2017 and the South African Revenue Services claims that he owes it more than R48 000. However, his case was postponed to November 13 with his legal team stated that they need time to engage with Sars and make arrangements pertaining to his tax debacles. Prosecutor Advocate Dudu Robertse said Seiphemo has until November 13 to file representations to Sars to make an arrangement. "He must liaise with Sars; if that's not done the State is proceeding with case," Robertse said. Seiphemo's legal team apologised to the court, saying that they had tried in vain to make amends. The veteran actor looked calm during proceedings. He was accompanied by his on-screen lover Zoe Mthiyane who plays the role ofÂ  Zitha in the soapie. It was confirmed late last year after much speculation that the duo is also a couple off-screen. The Star
